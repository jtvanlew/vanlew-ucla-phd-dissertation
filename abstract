\abstract{Predictive models of temperature distributions in packed beds of ceramics, beyond initial packing states, are critical for operation of solid breeders in fusion reactors. The importance of high-fidelity predictive capabilities is due to relatively narrow operational temperature windows imposed on solid breeders for optimum tritium release performance. Heat transfer in pebble beds is characterized by complex coupling between mechanical forces and heat conductance among individual pebbles. Modeling heat transfer, as a consequence, has traditionally advanced by treating packed beds as fictitious continua. This simplification allows pebble beds to be characterized with simpler phenomenological models of effective material properties fit to simple unit-cell structures and experimental data. 

A parameter often used to relate heat transfer in beds is the packing state, itself a macroscopic reflection of microscopic interactions. Continuous changes to packing states are expected in solid breeders due to high temperatures and forces in ceramic pebble regions. Therefore, predictions from continuum models begin to deviate from the realistic condition due to their applicability to specific packing states. Consequently, because we desire precise predictive capabilities in order to ensure satisfaction of narrow temperature windows in solid breeders, current modeling approaches based on continuum assumptions are insufficient for ceramic breeder pebble beds of solid breeders. In the current study, a multi-scale approach is adopted as an alternative; the approach will allow direct modeling of packing structures and temperature distributions.

Several phenomena are identified as capable of causing alterations to packing structures in solid breeders and thereby heat transfer properties, including: (i) inter-particle sintering, or necking; (ii) creep relaxation; (iii) crushing/cracking of individual pebbles in ensembles. These phenomena, and their specific changes to temperature distributions in pebble beds, will each require individualized attention and modeling efforts. In this study, I focus on heat transfer phenomena and develop predictive capabilities for temperature distributions in pebble beds with packing structures solely altered by pebble crushing and fragmentation.

From the microscopic point-of-view, the thermal discrete element method (DEM) is used to track motions of, and heat transfer between, individual pebbles in packed bed assemblies. DEM models provide an opportunity to study transient changes to packing structures and simulate pebble fragmentation and heat transfer. The slow-moving, interstitial helium purge gas is considered by coupling DEM models with two modeling approaches, differentiated by their scale. In the first approach, the fluid is considered with a macroscopic, volume-averaged computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. Volume-averaged models of helium are computationally efficient and provide an overall view of helium influence on heat transfer in solid breeder pebble beds. To gain insight into the complete fluid flow patterns and heat transfer in packed beds with changing packing states, a second microscopic approach with the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is also employed. The lattice-Boltzmann method is well-suited to fluid modeling of complex porous structures due to its inherent parallelizability and simple application of solid-fluid interface boundary conditions. CFD-DEM and LBM-DEM models were validated against known heat transfer states with stagnant interstitial gases from experiments.

Coupled CFD-DEM model are applied to ITER-relevant solid breeder volumes to parametrically consider fragmentation and orientation on temperatures in their pebble beds. We discovered that changes in packing structure and subsequent changes to pebble bed temperature distributions are sensitive to, in decreasing order: initial packing states (characterized by initial packing fractions); pebble fragmentation size; breeder unit orientation; and extent of pebble fragmentation (characterized by percent of crushed pebbles). At present, it is not possible to determine what percent of crushed pebbles should be expected in pebble beds of fusion reactors during their duty cycles, but the results of this study provides guidance on limits. For example, in this study when 1\% of pebbles were crushed, maximum temperatures in pebble beds increased by less than 5\%. However, when the number of crushed pebbles increased to 5\%, between 10 and 20\% increases in maximum bed temperatures were observed (among all parametrically studied pebble beds). To maintain within operational temperature windows, these results guide the tolerability of crushed pebbles in given pebble bed regions and orientations. We also discovered that, to the extent of pebble crushing considered in this study, no gap was formed between walls and pebble assemblies due to a slight pre-compaction force applied to the pebble beds. The result is strong support for the need to pre-compact pebble beds during the construction of solid breeder units. Finally, we determined that an important contribution to temperature distributions were affected by small crush fragments traveling through interstitial gaps in pebble beds and creating small regions of increased nuclear heating due to redistribution of mass; temperature responses of beds with traveling fragments were also dependent upon breeder orientation.

The lattice-Boltzmann method allowed us to study the tortuous path of helium through packed beds of spheres with and without crush fragments. Unlike traditional CFD methods for packed beds, no simplifications of contact regions was required and a direct mapping of DEM packing structures onto LBM lattice nodes was performed. Owing to the small Peclet number of pebble beds under consideration, transverse dispersion of heat was found to be negligible for fusion-relevant flow conditions. In essence, as long as small Peclet-number flows are expected in solid breeders, volume-averaged models (CFD-DEM) are valid and much more computationally efficient. Assuming that Peclet-dispersive conductivity relations stand for poly-disperse pebble beds, an 80\% packing fraction could increase dispersive conductivity ten-fold from what we observed in our numerical experiments. However, we saw that when two beds had equivalent packing fractions, poly-disperse beds (the packed bed with crush fragments) had significantly higher transverse dispersive conductivity. Our results inspire future study with our lattice-Boltzmann tools to study novel concepts for increasing heat transfer in packed beds in order to increase power density, such as the increase in dispersive conductivity due to mixed pebble beds and high packing fractions.

The models developed for this thesis, and the results obtained when they were applied to fusion-relevant pebble bed systems, have helped push the state-of-the-art in pebble bed heat transfer modeling and predictive capability. The results have impressed upon the fusion community that considerations of transient, inter-particle rearrangements have a significant effect on overall heat transfer in solid breeders. }
