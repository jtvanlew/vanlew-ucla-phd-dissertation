\abstract{Ceramic pebble beds as tritium breeders in fusion reactors must endure enormous nuclear energy depositions while satisfying energy and tritium fuel production requirements. To accomplish these feats, pebble beds must maintain ceramic temperatures within relatively-narrow prescribed operating windows while facilitating transport of high quality heat into coolants flowing through structural containers. The ceramic pebble beds exist with meta-stable packing structures that will evolve from thermal transients which generate external and internal forces during long-term operation as tritium breeders. As a consequence, predictive models of solid breeder heat transfer characteristics must contend with transitory packing structures and the changing modes of heat transfer they present. To provide such predictive modeling, microscale numerical models were developed allowing investigation of thermal transport in pebble beds operating in environmental conditions relevant to planned fusion reactors. Furthermore, in this work, specific effort was made to apply the predictive models toward simulating pebble bed thermomechanical responses to a fault condition of crushed individual pebbles.

In this work, the thermal discrete element method (DEM) is used to track motions of, and heat transfer between, individual pebbles that make up packed bed ensembles. Slow-moving, interstitial helium purge gas is considered by coupling the DEM model with thermofluid models. Two approaches for modeling packed bed two-phase flow are adopted, differentiated by their treatment of conservation equations. First, the fluid is considered with a mesoscopic, volume-averaged computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method. Volume-averaged models of helium are computationally efficient and provide an overall view of helium influence on heat transfer in solid breeder pebble beds. Second, to gain insight into the complete fluid flow patterns and heat transfer in packed beds with changing packing states, a microscopic approach for fluid modeling with the lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is employed. The lattice-Boltzmann method solves for density distribution functions on regularized lattice nodes and is well-suited to modeling complex porous structures (such as packed beds) due to its inherent parallelizability and simple application of solid-fluid interface boundary conditions on structured grids. 

Several open-source codes have been used as platforms for launching the numerical experiments. The codes provided basic numerical frameworks for, \textit{e.g.} time integration, particle tracking, mesh decomposition, and streaming/colliding operators. However, stock codes are not sufficient for modeling the complex interaction of pebble beds in fusion reactors. Therefore, in order to accomplish the objectives of this thesis, the following contributions to code development were: stochastic numerical implementation of `apparent' Young moduli distributions measured for pebble batches; model of surface roughness effects for heat transfer contact conductance between pebbles in an ensemble; a mass- and energy-conserving pebble fragmentation algorithm with an overlap-relaxation technique for velocity-Verlet integration of position; implementation of the Jeffreson correction in calculation of inter-phase exchange coefficient in CFD-DEM coupling for handling moderate-to-high Biot number conditions.

Numerical simulations of pebble beds with stagnant interstitial helium are used to validate the numerical models. Effective thermal conductivity values are used as quantitative criterion for validation against macroscopic measurements of experimental data. The DEM and CFD-DEM models agreed well with experiments of lithium ceramic pebble beds in both vacuum and stagnant helium; results in helium have negligible error compared to uncertainty in experimental data. The predictive capability of the models were then demonstrated with validation against a broad range of solid-to-fluid conductivity ratio packed bed experimental data. The CFD-DEM model, in ideal conditions also agrees well with the commonly-applied SZB correlation. The predictive models developed in this thesis offer the most complete view of the underlying causes of thermomechanical expressions of packed beds. 

%They have been applied in parametric studies of fusion-relevant representative volume pebble beds to reveal new phenomena that have not yet been considered from standard experimental and modeling efforts. Three main application studies were performed to consider: (i) effective thermal conductivity responses to solid conductivity reductions due to irradiation damage; (ii) changes to temperature distributions in ITER-relevant solid breeders as a function of many variables, including crushing, fragmentation, and resettling; and (iii) complete helium flow fields, tortuosity, conjugate heat transfer, and transverse dispersive conductivity changes in packed beds with crushed pebble fragments. The microscale nature of models developed for this thesis made possible the uncovering of several critical and consequential phenomena.

In fully-dynamic CFD-DEM simulations of ITER-relevant packed beds, new phenomena have been predicted by the model. Mass re-distribution in pebble beds following crush events, dependent on the size and extent of fragmentation, was shown to induce subtle changes to local packing fractions yet result in macroscopically consequential changes to temperature distributions with volumetric heating. In the worst case of small fragments and wide-spread pebble damage, maximum bed temperatures increased by approximately 14\% under a nuclear heating rate of \SI{8}{\mega\watt\per\cubic\meter}. Moreover, horizontal-style configurations of coolant interfaces, such as in the EU HCPB design for ITER, were shown to be much more tolerant to pebble fragmentation than previously considered. The configuration’s orientation relative to the gravity vector resulted in slight `broadening’ of temperature profiles, and even slightly lower peak-to-average temperatures than vertical-style configurations, as packing structures evolved due to fragmentation. However, recent studies of contact forces as a function of external pressure on the bed indicate that pebble fragmentation to the extent considered in the parametric study of this thesis are unlikely to occur. For small quantities of crushing, the effects on thermomechanics are predicted to be relatively minor compared to other phenomena such as contact creep inside the pebble bed. Based on the results of this thesis, future modeling of pebble bed thermomechanics should focus on high-performance concepts to increase effective conductivity (\textit{e.g.} mixed beryllide/ceramic volumes) rather than the negative effects of pebble crushing.

The LBM models used in this thesis validated the accuracy of the volume-averaged approach of fluid flow and energy interaction between solid and fluid phases, as adopted in the CFD-DEM model. From the LBM results, laminar nature of low-Reynolds flow in packed beds implies conduction is the dominant mode of heat transfer through the packed bed. The maximum difference between temperature profiles predicted with CFD-DEM and LBM-DEM models was only 6\%, while CFD-DEM simulations were run in considerably less time than the full models of LBM-DEM (hours compared to days). Nevertheless, the small differences between LBM and CFD-DEM results arose due to increases in transverse dispersive conductivity of the fluid which itself suggest larger Reynolds or higher packing fraction pebble beds may benefit from increased transverse dispersion to handle higher heat deposition with slightly increased effective conductivity. The LBM model of fluid and solid interaction should be used for future studies of this topic.
%The contribution of transverse dispersive conductivity, a heat transfer mechanism not accounted for in CFD-DEM, was shown to be not significant for the range of Reynolds/Peclet numbers of interest for purge gas in solid breeders and the failure percentages in the packed bed configurations considered; the dispersive component of conductivity, even in beds with fragments and higher tortuosity, was only 0.5\% of the total effective thermal conductivity.
