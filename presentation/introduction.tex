\begin{frame}{Background and Motivation}
Many solid breeder designs are now employing a \textbf{breeder unit} configuration
\begin{itemize}
	\item Packed sub-modules of ceramic pebble beds
	\item Units individually tested experimentally and qualified during design phase
\end{itemize}

Must understand how packing states may evolve from time-dependent phenomena (\text{e.g.} pebble damage from crushing, sintering, creep, etc.)
\begin{itemize}
	\item Decrease in effective thermal conductivity raises bed temperatures
	\item Pebble isolation creating hot spots and sintering -- potentially decreasing tritium release rates
\item Gap formation decreases interfacial heat conductance and leads to neutron streaming, etc.
\end{itemize}
