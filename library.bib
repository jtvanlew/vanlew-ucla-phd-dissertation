abstract = {AbstractAn experimental study of thermal convection in a horizontal porous layer bounded by isothermal planes has been performed with and without a mean flow of the saturating fluid phase. The temperature distribution and heat transfer resulting from convection have been determined.The theoretical criterion for the onset of convection (Rayleigh number NRa {\textgreater} 4p2) has been verified. For low values of NRa ({\textless} 260) a regular pattern of convective cells has been observed which may be motionless or moving depending on the experimental conditions. For NRa values higher than 260, another convective state has been found that is mainly unstable.Numerical computations have been worked out that confirm the experimental results on the heat transfer and size of convective cells.INTRODUCTIONThermal convective currents may exist in a porous medium when the vertical component of the temperature gradient runs in the same direction as the gravity vector. Such a configuration is possible in some cases during a real in-situ combustion test4 or during hot fluid injection. A general understanding of convection is also of interest for analyzing the abnormal temperature gradients sometimes observed in oil and gas reservoirs.22From the phenomenological standpoint a distinction must be made between the natural or free convection occurring in a closed volume and the mixed or combined free and forced convection arising when there is a mean flow of the fluid phase.Natural convection in porous media has been the subject of numerous experimental attempts to determine a convection criterion, e.g., by using a linear theory,1,2,9 and to measure the mean heat transfer.3,7 Numerical studies8,10,15,19,20 have also been made, and their results are not always in good agreement with experimental observations. However, no thorough study of mixed convection has been made except for a theoretical analysis of the convection onset criterion5 and some qualitative experimental observations.4This paper presents some findings concerning both the natural and mixed convection of an incompressible fluid in a homogeneous horizontal porous layer bounded by two parallel impervious isothermal surfaces. The temperature for the cooler upper surface is T1 and that of the lower surface is T2=T1+?T.THEORETICAL ANALYSISThe effect of pressure on specific gravity is assumed to be negligible with regard to the effect of thermal expansion. So the relationship between density and temperature may be expressed as:Equation 1In addition to complying with equations for motion and continuity, velocity and temperature distributions obey the heat transfer equation:Equation 2By taking into account the additivity property of enthalpy, M may be expressed asEquation 3On the contrary, khR is not just a simple function of khj and khs and must be measured or calculated with different kinds of models.6},

@article{Issa1986,
abstract = {A non-iterative method for handling the coupling of the implicitly discretised time-dependent fluid flow equations is described. The method is based on the use of pressure and velocity as dependent variables and is hence applicable to both the compressible and incompressible versions of the transport equations. The main feature of the technique is the splitting of the solution process into a series of steps whereby operations on pressure are decoupled from those on velocity at each step, with the split sets of equations being amenable to solution by standard techniques. At each time-step, the procedure yields solutions which approximate the exact solution of the difference equations. The accuracy of this splitting procedure is assessed for a linearised form of the discretised equations, and the analysis indicates that the solution yielded by it differs from the exact solution of the difference equations by terms proportional to the powers of the time-step size. By virtue of this, it is possible to dispense with iteration, thus resulting in an efficient implicit scheme while retaining simplicity of implementation relative to contemporary block simultaneous methods. This is verified in a companion paper which presents results of computations carried out using the method.},

It has two fitting parameters, the width and average radius of the narrow gaps that exist between the irregularly shaped particles and which contribute significantly to the thermal conductivity. Since both parameters are physically measurable, the model holds the potential for calculating the thermal conductivity without any adjustable parameters. Agreement is excellent with measurements on alumina particles in helium at 100–500°C up to 100 kPa pressure.},

abstract = {Heat transfer between particles takes place in a variety of industrial applications, but because of the stress and contact heterogeneities inherent to these applications, it is poorly understood, even in simple cases. Although particle-particle heat transfer is relatively weak compared with particle-fluid convection heat transfer, it may become very important in applications such as packed beds, where the fluid flow can be neglected or where fluid/particle stagnation areas can be observed. During our previous studies, CFD-DEM models and numerical simulations were developed to account for momentum and heat transfer between the fluid and the solid particles. The predictions of the simulations were validated with experimental data. In the present study, particle-particle and particle-wall heat transfer models were developed and integrated into our in-house unsteady three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) software. Heat transfer simulations for predicting the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of particulate beds under compression were conducted to validate these models with published experimental data. The results showed good agreement with the experimental data, and it was found that heat conduction through the bed's pores cannot be neglected even when particle thermal conductivity is much larger than that of the air.The influence of particle roughness on heat transfer through packed bed was examined. It was found that heat conduction through the packed bed pores cannot be neglected for rough particles. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Tritium produced inside the breeder can enter the metal structures and can be lost by permeation to the environment.

abstract = {Fluid flow through packed beds of uniform spheres is studied by a parallel lattice-Boltzmann (LB) model. The packed beds are obtained from simulations based on discrete element methods and have a wide porosity range. The LB model is specially designed for particle systems and is validated by comparing the simulated and measured results under different conditions. The validated model is then used to study the effect of porosity on the internal fluid flow and quantify the drag force on particles in packed beds. The results suggest that both the Reynolds number and packing structure significantly affect the fluid velocity distribution. A correlation is demonstrated between the packing structure and the velocity distribution, especially for flows at low Reynolds numbers. Beds with large porosity subjected to relatively large (e.g. moderate) Reynolds numbers are prone to display a secondary peak in the probability distribution of the normalized velocity. The interaction forces between particles and fluid in packed beds are examined. As a result of the non-uniform structure and flow, the drag force on a single particle varies giving a probability distribution. Based on the simulated results, a new equation is proposed to estimate the mean drag force on particles, which is more accurate than the correlations in the literature. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A mechanistic model for the description of helium swelling and tritium release in neutron-irradiated beryllium is presented. Initially aimed at predicting the mechanical stability and the tritium retention capacity of beryllium in a fusion reactor blanket, the ANFIBE code was finally extended to provide an exhaustive description of the properties of this material under fast neutron irradiation. In-solid diffusion and precipitation of helium and tritium, radiation re-solution, and bubble growth and coalescence in different structural domains of the material are taken into account and formulated in a compact rate equation system, enabling the evolution of swelling and release to be calculated under stationary and nonstationary irradiation and temperature conditions. A particular feature of the model is the treatment of the growth of gas bubbles and pores in the interactive compressive stress field created by the gas precipitated in cavities of different sizes and at different pressures, enabling a realistic and accurate calculation of the stress-sensitive intergranular-swelling components and of the related pore-venting effects. The salient physical hypotheses of the model are discussed, as well as the formalism adopted for the description of helium and tritium diffusion precipitation and swelling.},

abstract = {The optimal relaxation time of about 0.8090 has been proposed to balance the efficiency, stability, and accuracy at a given lattice size of numerical simulations with lattice Boltzmann methods. The optimal lattice size for a desired Reynolds number can be refined by reducing the Mach number for incompressible flows. The functioned polylogarithm polynomials are defined and used to express the lattice Boltzmann equations at different time scales and to analyze the impact of relaxation times and lattice sizes on truncation errors. Smaller truncation errors can be achieved when relaxation times are greater than 0.5 and less than 1.0. The steady-state lid-driven cavity flow was chosen to validate the code of lattice Boltzmann procedures. The applications of the optimal relaxation parameters numerically balance the stability, efficiency, and accuracy through Hartmann flow. The optimal relaxation time can also be used to select the initial lattice size for the channel flow over a square cylinder with a given Mach number. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of the duct having conducting walls are investigated. Exact solutions are obtained for two cases, (i) perfectly conducting walls perpendicular to the field and thin walls of arbitrary conductivity parallel to the field, and (ii) non-conducting walls parallel to the field and thin walls of arbitrary conductivity perpendicular to the field. The boundary layers on the walls parallel to the field are studied in case (i) and it is found that at high Hartmann number (M), large positive and negative velocities of order NV, are induced, where V, is the velocity of the core. It is suggested that contrary to previous assumptions the magnetic field may in some cases have a destabilizing effect on flow in ducts.},

abstract = {Effects of tortuosity and dispersion on the effective thermal conductivity of fluid-saturated porous media are investigated analytically with help of a volume averaging theory. Firstly, a general expression for the effective stagnant thermal conductivity has been derived using a unit cell model, which consists of rectangular solids with connecting arms in an in-line arrangement. The validity of the expression for the stagnant thermal conductivity has been confirmed comparing the present results with available experimental and theoretical data for packed beds, porous foams and wire screens. Secondly, an general expression for the thermal dispersion conductivity has been sought with help of the two energy equations for solid and fluid phases, derived on the basis of a volume averaging theory. It has been shown that the interstitial heat transfer between the solid and fluid phases is closely associated with the thermal dispersion. The resulting expressions for the longitudinal and transverse thermal dispersion conductivities agree well with available experimental data and empirical correlations. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A macroscopically uniform flow is assumed to pass through a collection of square rods placed regularly in an infinite space, where a macroscopically linear temperature gradient is imposed perpendicularly to the flow direction. Due to the periodicity of the model, only one structural unit is taken for a calculation domain to resolve an entire domain of porous medium. Continuity, Navier–Stokes and energy equations are solved numerically to describe the microscopic velocity and temperature fields at a pore scale. The numerical results thus obtained are integrated over a unit structure to evaluate the thermal dispersion and the molecular diffusion due to tortuosity. The resulting correlation for a high-Peclet-number range agrees well with available experimental data.},

This paper presents recent achievements of research activities for the TBM, particularly addressing the pebble bed of the tritium breeder materials and tritium behaviour. For the breeder material, the chemical stability of Li 2 TiO 3 was improved using Li 2 O additives. To analyse the pebble bed behaviour, thermomechanical properties of the Li 2 TiO 3 pebble bed were assessed experimentally. To verify the pebble bed's nuclear properties, the activation foil method was proposed and a preliminary experiment was conducted. To reduce the tritium permeation, the chemical densified coating method was developed and the coating was attached to F82H steel.

abstract = {Europe has developed two reference tritium breeder blankets concepts that will be tested in ITER under the form of Test Blanket Modules: (i) the Helium-Cooled Lithium–Lead which uses the liquid Pb–15.7Li as both breeder and neutron multiplier, (ii) the Helium-Cooled Pebble-Bed with lithiated ceramic pebbles as breeder and beryllium pebbles as neutron multiplier. An extensive development program has been carried-out over the last decade combining experimental and numerical simulations aimed at identifying and quantifying physical phenomena occurring in breeder blankets and at optimizing their design and technologies accordingly. On this basis, sound guidelines for the design and technological choices of Test Blanket Modules can be derived. In addition, regulatory and ITER project requirements, which prefigure the future DEMO blanket ones, are now integrated in the development and qualification program of the Test Blanket Modules. Their scope and implication are analyzed.},

Each individual pebble is considered as one element obeying equilibrium conditions under contact forces. We study not only the rearrangement of particles but also the overall behaviour of an assembly under the action of macroscopic compressive stresses. Using random close packing as initial configurations, the discrete element simulation of the uniaxial compression test has been quantitatively compared to experiments. This method yields the distribution of the inter-particle contact forces. Moreover, the micro-macro relations have been investigated to relate the microscopic information, such as the maximum contact force and the coordination number inside the assembly, to the macroscopic stress variables.},

abstract = {Quasi-static shear deformation of granular media is examined by performing numerical simulations on polydisperse systems of elastic spheres in a periodic cell. Results of axisymmetric compression test simulations are reported for both a dense and a loose system of spheres sheared under constant mean stress conditions. At the macroscopic scale, the simulated stress-strain-dilation responses are in excellent qualitative agreement with the mechanical behaviour of sand observed in real experiments. Numerical simulation permits a detailed examination of the evolution of internal variables associated with the micromechanical processes occurring at the particle scale. In this context, we present and discuss the evolution of the induced structural anisotropy, the percentage of sliding contacts, the average coordination number and the normal and tangential contact-force contributions to the stress tensor. Encouraged by recent research published by physicists working on granular media, we show how the distribution of normal contact forces evolves during shear, and how it is affected by changing the particle modulus and stress level. This work has led us to consider two types of interparticle contacts: (1) the contacts carrying below-average normal contact forces; and (2) the contacts carrying above-average normal contact forces. We examine how these two different categories contribute to the stress tensor and the structural anisotropy tensor. As a consequence, we present information that provides new insights into the physics of granular media and clarifies some previous findings.},

abstract = {In the frame of the activities of the European Test Blanket Module Consortium of Associates the Helium-Cooled Pebble-Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB TBM) is developed in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) to investigate DEMO relevant concepts for blanket modules. A series of four different HCPB TBMs of the EU will be installed into the ITER Vacuum Vessel connected to one dedicated equatorial port. During different test campaigns, the 4 TBMs will test the three main functions of a blanket module (removing heat, breeding tritium and shielding sensitive components from radiation). In 2006-2007 a preliminary version of the HCPB TBM sub-components design has been proposed extrapolating the neutronic analyses performed for the horizontal HCPB TBM. With the input data provided by the preliminary design, together with the ITER 3D 40° toroidal sector model, new nuclear analyses for the vertical HCPB TBM have been performed. Nuclear results are necessary to assess the sub-components design and to validate the design of the HCPB TBM: with this aim thermal analyses of a 1/4 scaled assembly of the vertical HCPB TBM have been performed. As the generation of data in ITER supporting the design of DEMO is very important in the road map to the commercial fusion reactor, the results of nuclear and thermal analyses are fundamental to perform studies concerning the TBM DEMO relevancy. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

@article{Kwok2013,
abstract = {One mechanism that may contribute to creep in sand is that heavily loaded grains may progressively crush, following the growth of microcracks due to hydrolysis at crack tips. Weibull's statistical model of brittle failure can accommodate these time effects. Discrete-element modelling (DEM) simulations of the temporal deterioration of loaded grains were conducted using Robertson's bonded agglomerates of microspheres to represent the grains. A time-dependent failure equation that describes crack growth corresponding to increasing grain stress was developed. The equation was incorporated into a single DEM agglomerate to simulate the deterioration of loaded grains. It is found that a particular relationship can be derived between the rate of loss of bond strength at a contact and the tension carried at that contact, such that the Weibull modulus of this rate-dependent model matches that of short-term loading tests on individual sand grains. A strength–probability–time diagram was generated that enables estimation of delayed fracture. The predicted grain strength decreases in a nearly linear fashion with the logarithm of time, which is in good agreement with previous results for ceramics. This DEM technique was then applied to the simulation of creep in a triaxial test with 378 breakable grains. The DEM results show that crack growth can lead to softening of samples with volumetric contraction due to grain breakage accompanying dilation due to shearing. Creep-induced failure might be anticipated when the axial strain reaches about 5{\%}.},

@article{Hernandez2013,
abstract = {The complexity of the experimental set-up for testing a full-scaled Breeder Unit (BU) mock-up for the European Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB-TBM) has motivated to build a pre-test mock-up experiment (PREMUX) consisting of a slice of the BU in the Li4SiO4 region. This pre-test aims at verifying the feasibility of the methods to be used for the subsequent testing of the full-scaled BU mock-up. Key parameters needed for the modeling of the breeder material is also to be determined by the Hot Wire Method (HWM). The modeling tools for the thermo-mechanics of the pebble beds and for the mock-up structure are to be calibrated and validated as well. This paper presents the setting-up of PREMUX in the L-STAR/LL facility at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A key requirement of the experiments is to mimic the neutronic volumetric heating. A new heater concept is discussed and compared to several conventional heater configurations with respect to the estimated temperature distribution in the pebble beds. The design and integration of the thermocouple system in the heater matrix and pebble beds is also described, as well as other key aspects of the mock-up (dimensions, layout, cooling system, purge gas line, boundary conditions and integration in the test facility). The adequacy of these methods for the full-scaled BU mock-up is discussed and the next steps that follow PREMUX set-up are shown. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {A solid breeder blanket was selected as the primary candidate blanket of the fusion power demonstration plant (DEMO plant) in Japan. Test blanket module (TBM) testing in ITER is the most important milestone for the development of the blanket of the DEMO plant. Therefore, the major development effort has been focused on the development of the TBMs in Japan. This paper presents a structural concept of solid breeder TBMs cooled by pressurized water and helium gas. In the sub-module concept which was developed, a slitted box structure was adopted for both TBMs to simulate the DEMO blanket structure and to endure the over-pressurization in case of the coolant ingress to box structure. The breeder and neutron multiplier formed by small pebbles are packed separately in a layered structure. Detailed internal structure was developed with consideration of fabrication procedure, coolant flow route and purge gas flow route. Coolant flow route was considered from the view points of thermal-hydraulic and heat transfer performances. As for He purge gas flow passages, separated passages for tritium breeder layers and neutron multiplier layers were adapted to avoid tritium migration to the neutron multiplier layers. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the rigid ball limit, we find a continuous transition in which the stress vanishes as (straight phi-straight phi(c))(beta), where straight phi is the (solid phase) volume density. The value of straight phi(c) depends on whether the grains interact via only normal forces (giving rise to random close packings) or by a combination of normal and friction generated transverse forces (producing random loose packings). In both cases, near the transition, the system's response is controlled by localized force chains.},

It is defined either as an average elongation of fluid paths or as a retardation factor that measures the resistance of a porous medium to the flow. However, in contrast to a retardation factor, an average fluid path elongation is difficult to compute numerically and, in general, is not measurable directly in experiments. We review some recent achievements in bridging the gap between the two formulations of tortuosity and discuss possible method of numerical and an experimental measurements of the tortuosity directly from the fluid velocity field.},

abstract = {An analysis of the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method is conducted, and various conclusions are drawn on how to exploit this method for the numerical resolution of the Navier-Stokes equation. A novel LB model is introduced, first for the simulation of advection-diffusion problems, and then for the resolution of the Navier-Stokes equation. The latter model, presented under the name of "regularized lattice Boltzmann", is shown to substantially increase the stability and accuracy of LB models in numerical simulaiton. The model is furthermore found to be innovative due to the fact that it possesses an accurate dimensionless formulation in terms of macroscopic variables. Based on this observation, the regularized model is investigated to address various challenges of LB, such as the implementaiton of boundary conditions and spatially refined grids.},

abstract = {A one-point collocation analysis is performed on the two-dimensional pseudohomogeneous model of a fixed bed heat-exchanger. The analysis is based on a single radial collocation point whose position depends on the wall Biot number. The resulting improved equation for the overall heat transfer coefficient U is 1/U = 1/hw + Rt/3kr Bi+3/Bi+4 which gives an error less than 3.8{\%} in the exact asymptotic value of U over the entire range of Bi. A formula is also given for U′, the overall heat transfer coefficient based on the difference between tube wall and bed center temperatures. The synthesis of vinyl acetate in a fixed bed reactor was simulated. Use of the conventional one-dimensional model with the improved equation for U, combined with the equation for U′ to obtain bed center temperatures, gave predictions of acetylene conversion and bed center temperature in good agreement with those of the two-dimensional model. A criterion for the neglect of radial temperature gradients in a fixed bed reactor is derived which is more stringent than criteria currently available in the literature.},

abstract = {On-site boundary conditions are often desired for lattice Boltzmann simulations of fluid flow in complex geometries such as those of porous media or microfluidic devices. The possibility of specifying the exact position of the boundary, independently of other simulation parameters, simplifies the analysis of the system. For practical applications it should allow one to freely specify the direction of the flux, and it should be straightforward to implement in three dimensions. Furthermore, especially for parallelized solvers, it is of great advantage if the boundary condition can be applied locally, involving only information available on the current lattice site. We meet this need by describing in detail how to transfer the approach suggested by Zou and He to a D3Q19 lattice. The boundary condition acts locally, is independent of the details of the relaxation process during collision and contains no artificial slip. In particular, the case of an on-site no-slip boundary condition is naturally included. We test the boundary condition in several setups and confirm that it can be used to accurately model the velocity field up to second order and does not contain any numerical slip.},

abstract = {A detailed knowledge of the fluid flow profile and of the radial heat transfer parameters is essential for a proper design of fixed-bed processes. For different sphere, ring and cylinder catalysts radial velocity profiles were measured below the fixed-bed at empty tube velocities of air between 0.5 m??s-1 {\textless} ??0 {\textless} 1.5 m??s-1 and tube to particle diameter ratios 3.3 {\textless} dt/dp {\textless} 11. As a consequence of the statistical behaviour of packings, it was necessary to average velocity measurements after repacking in order to obtain representative flow profiles. All profiles show a velocity maximum in the vicinity of the wall. In order to relate the measured profiles below the packing to the velocity profiles inside the packing, model simulations have been performed. The model is based on the extended Brinkman equation and the independently determined radial void fraction profiles. It considers an "effective viscosity" for which correlations have been derived for spheres, cylinders and rings. Radial heat transfer parameters were obtained experimentally from packings between two parallel plates of different temperatures. The determined heat transfer parameters can be transformed to the round cross section of a tube by considering the respective radial velocity profiles. The transformed values of the effective heat conductivity could be well described by literature correlations. For the heat transfer coefficient at the wall a new correlation was developed. ?? 2001 ??ditions scientifiques et m??dicales Elsevier SAS.},

The beryllium thermal conductivity is determining the maximum pebblebed temperature and, therefore, is very important for blanket design. Different grades of beryllium discs were neutron-irradiated at temperatures between 343 and 673 K and at fluences up to 1.6 × 1023 cm−2. At lower irradiation temperatures a significant drop of the beryllium thermal conductivity occurs even after small neutron fluences. With increasing neutron fluence, further moderate decreases of the conductivity are observed. With increasing irradiation temperature, the thermal conductivity further decreases. If the thermal conductivity of the irradiated beryllium is known, the conductivity of irradiated beryllium pebblebeds can be assessed using the model suggested in this study.},

The contact area and normal stiffness rise linearly with the applied load, and the load rises exponentially with decreasing separation between surfaces. Results for a wide range of roughness, system size, and Poisson ratio can be collapsed using Persson's contact theory for continuous elastic media. The compliance due to atomic-scale motion at the interface between solids has little effect on the area and normal stiffness, but can reduce the total transverse stiffness by orders of magnitude. The scaling of this effect with system size is discussed.},

abstract = {Beryllides have many interesting properties at high temperature and are candidate materials as advanced neutron multiplier for DEMO Reactor blanket developed by JAERI. A new blanket design with mixed pebble packing of neutron multiplier and tritium breeder has been proposed to improve tritium breeding ratio (TBR). Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the compatibility between the neutron multiplier and the tritium breeder. In this study, the compatibility between Be12Ti and Li2TiO3 was investigated. The compatibility between Be and Li2TiO3 was also investigated for the comparison with the case of Be12Ti. When the Be12Ti specimen was placed in contact with Li 2TiO3, neither reaction products nor diffusion of Li in beryllide were found after annealing during 1000 h at 800 ??C. In the case of Be specimen in contact with Li2TiO3 no reaction products were observed, however, a diffusion of Li into Be was identified after annealing for more than 300 h at 800??C. These results show that the compatibility of Be12Ti with Li2TiO3 was higher than that of Be, therefore, from the point of view of compatibility mixed pebble beds of neutron multiplier Be12Ti and tritium breeder Li2TiO3 pebbles can be used in a blanket. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {This paper studies the steady motion of an electrically conducting; viscous fluid along channels in the presence of an imposed transverse magnetic field when the walls do not conduct currents. The equations which determine the velocity profile; induced currents and field are derived and solved exactly in the case of a rectangular channel. When the imposed field is sufficiently strong the velocity profile is found to degenerate into a core of uniform flow surrounded by boundary layers on each wall. The layers on the walls parallel to the imposed field are of a novel character. An analogous degenerate solution for channels of any symmetrical shape is developed. The predicted pressure gradients for given volumes of flow at various field strengths are finally compared with experimental results for square and circular pipes.},

abstract = {Image-based pore-scale modeling has become an important tool for studying fluid transport and other phenomena in porous media. Spatial resolution of the digital images used for modeling is critical not only because it dictates the scale of features that can be resolved, but also because for most techniques there is at least some relationship between voxel size in the image data and numerical resolution applied to the computational simulations. In this work we investigate this relationship using a computer-generated consolidated porous medium, which was digitized at voxel resolutions in the range 2-10. ??m. These images, which are free of experimental and segmentation errors, are then used to compute permeability and tortuosity using lattice Boltzmann (LB) and finite elements methods (FEM). Results show how changes in computed permeability are affected by image resolution (which dictates how well the pore geometry is approximated) versus grid or mesh resolution (which changes numerical accuracy). For LB, the image and grid resolution are usually taken to be the same; we show at least one case where effects of grid and image resolution appear to counteract one another, giving the mistaken appearance of resolution-independent results. For FEM, meshing can provide certain attributes (such as better conformance to surfaces), but it also adds an extra step for error or approximation to be introduced in the workflow. Results show that performing grid coarsening on the FEM mesh caused a reduction in computed permeability, but in this particular case the effect is related to tightening of the pore space rather than loss of numerical accuracy. ?? 2013.},

@article{Peeters2007,
abstract = {The irradiation programme EXOTIC (extraction of tritium in ceramics) is carried out within the European framework for the development of the helium cooled pebble bed concept. The EXOTIC-9/1 is the latest experiment in the series of EXOTICs that are irradiated in the high flux reactor in Petten. Tritium release and inventory in lithium containing ceramic pebbles are key properties to be tested in a TBM. New production routes of pebbles are developed, leading to different thermomechanical and tritium release properties. The objective of the EXOTIC-9/1 is to study in-pile tritium release behaviour of the latest developed lithiummetatitanate pebbles (Li2TiO3). The pebbles are produced by a extrusion-spheroidisation-sintering process at CEA. The new pebbles differ with respect to porosity from the lithiummetatitanate ceramics tested in the previous EXOTIC 8 programme. The pebbles have diameter in the range from 0.6 to 0.8 mm. Irradiation of EXOTC-9/1 started at 24 March 2005, and will continue until the end of 2006, in total about 400 irradiation days. The temperature is varied between 340 and 580 °C. Begin of Life (BOL) tritium production rate is 0.56 mCi/min. Based upon the in-pile tritium release measurements and the analysis of the tritium residence time it can be concluded that tritium release in the new batch of the high density Li2TiO3 pebbles irradiated in EXOTIC 9/1 is rather slow compared to the ceramics irradiated in the EXOTIC 8 irradiation campaign. In this paper, the in-pile tritium behaviour will be reported during normal operation and during transients in temperature, purge gas chemistry and gasflow. The collected data is compared to tritium release data from ceramics irradiated in previous EXOTIC experiments with respect to tritium inventory, residence time and porosity. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Spout-fluid beds find a widespread application in the process industry for efficient contacting of large particles with a gas. However, detailed understanding of the complex behavior of these systems is lacking, which leads to significant scale-up problems in industry. In this paper we report results of a combined experimental and simulation study on the various regimes, which can be encountered during spout-fluid bed operation. A regime map for a 3D spout-fluid bed was composed employing spectral analysis of pressure drop fluctuations and fast video recordings. In addition 3D Euler-Lagrange computations were performed to assess the capability of the model to reproduce the experimentally observed flow regimes. The influence of the drag closure on the model results was assessed and the influence of the computational grid was studied using a new method for the implementation of the two-way coupling, which is proposed in this paper. For most regimes our model is able to predict the appropriate regime. The frequency, at which the largest power is found, is overpredicted by the model. Contrary to the experimental observations, our model did not predict any large slugs in the slugging bed regime. The remaining differences between the simulated and experimentally observed bed behavior is most likely related to the representation of the effective fluid-particle interaction in our model, which relies on local spatial homogeneity. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The most advanced thermal energy storage for solar thermal power plants is a two-tank storage system where the heat transfer fluid (HTF) also serves as storage medium. This concept was successfully demonstrated in a commercial trough plant (13.8 MWe SEGS I plant; 120 MWht storage capacity) and a demonstration tower plant (10 MWe Solar Two; 105 MWht storage capacity). However, the HTF used in state-of-the-art parabolic trough power plants (30-80 MWe) is expensive, dramatically increasing the cost of larger HTF storage systems. An engineering study was carried out to evaluate a concept, where another (less expensive) liquid medium such as molten salt is utilized as storage medium rather than the HTF itself. Detailed performance and cost analyses were conducted to evaluate the economic value of this concept. The analyses are mainly based on the operation experience from the SEGS plants and the Solar Two project. The study concluded that the specific cost for a two-tank molten salt storage is in the range of US{\$} 30-40/kWhth depending on storage size. Since the salt storage was operated successfully in the Solar Two project, no major barriers were identified to realize this concept in the first commercial parabolic trough power plant.},

abstract = {We present numerical simulations of the cold isostatic and close die compaction of mixtures of soft and hard powders. The simulations use the discrete element method with periodic boundary conditions on packing of 4000 spherical monosize particles. The two mechanisms that are generally put forward to explain the retarding effect of hard particles on the compaction have been analysed. First, we have studied in which condition the hard particles form a cluster that hinders the homogeneous distribution of the load. Friction between particles is shown to affect significantly the formation of such a cluster. Second, the additional deformation that soft particles must undergo in the presence of hard non-deformable particles has been evaluated. Related to this last issue, the importance of including hardening effects in the constitutive equation of the soft phase is demonstrated. ?? 2002 Acta Materialia Inc.

@article{Gilabert2007,
abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are used to investigate the structure and mechanical properties of a simple two-dimensional model of a cohesive granular material. Intergranular forces involve elasticity, Coulomb friction, and a short-range attraction akin to the van der Waals force in powders. The effects of rolling resistance (RR) at intergranular contacts are also studied. The microstructure of the cohesive packing under low pressure is shown to depend sensitively on the assembling procedure which is applied to the initially isolated particles of a granular gas. While a direct compression produces a final equilibrated configuration with a similar density to that of cohesionless systems, the formation of large aggregates prior to the application of an external pressure results in much looser stable packings. A crucial state variable is the ratio P;{\{}*{\}}=PaF{\_}{\{}0{\}} of applied pressure P , acting on grains of diameter a , to maximum tensile contact force F0 . At low P;{\{}*{\}} the force-carrying structure and force distribution are sensitive to the level of velocity fluctuations in the early stages of cluster aggregation. The coordination number of packings with RR approaches 2 in the limit of low initial velocities or large rolling friction. In general the force network is composed of hyperstatic clusters, typically comprising four to a few tens of grains, in which forces reach values of the order of F0 , joined by barely rigid arms, where contact forces are very small. Under growing P;{\{}*{\}} , it quickly rearranges into force chainlike patterns that are more familiar in dense systems. Density correlations are interpreted in terms of a fractal structure, up to a characteristic correlation length xi of the order of ten particle diameters for the studied solid fractions. The fractal dimension in systems with RR coincides, within measurement uncertainties, with the ballistic aggregation result, in spite of a possibly different connectivity, but is apparently higher without RR. Possible effects of micromechanical and assembling process parameters on mechanical strength of packings are evoked.},

abstract = {In order to characterize ceramic breeder materials for fusion reactors, mechanical properties were measured on Li2SiO3, Li4SiO4, and also on some LiAlO2 samples for comparison. Literature data on thermal conductivity and thermal expansion of all breeder materials considered were compiled to compare their presumable sensitivity to thermal stresses. The highest level of thermal shock resistance is predicted for LiAlO2, and the lowest level for Li4SiO4. Thermal shock tests, made by dipping pellets into a hot metal melt, confined the relation for LiAlO2 and Li4SiO4. Young's modulus was determined by ultrasound velocity measurement, and fracture strength was measured on pellet samples under compression. The scatter in compressive strength is exceptionally large, partly due to various grain size, and does not suggest a definite ranking of the different breeder materials. Compressive creep tests were made at temperatures of 750-950°C for about 100 h each. An extrapolated creep rate of 10-6/h was used to estimate a conservative temperature limit of total microstructure stability. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

@article{Latt2008,
abstract = {Various ways of implementing boundary conditions for the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations by a lattice Boltzmann method are discussed. Five commonly adopted approaches are reviewed, analyzed, and compared, including local and nonlocal methods. The discussion is restricted to velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to straight on-lattice boundaries which are aligned with the horizontal and vertical lattice directions. The boundary conditions are first inspected analytically by applying systematically the results of a multiscale analysis to boundary nodes. This procedure makes it possible to compare boundary conditions on an equal footing, although they were originally derived from very different principles. It is concluded that all five boundary conditions exhibit second-order accuracy, consistent with the accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann method. The five methods are then compared numerically for accuracy and stability through benchmarks of two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows. None of the methods is found to be throughout superior to the others. Instead, the choice of a best boundary condition depends on the flow geometry, and on the desired trade-off between accuracy and stability. From the findings of the benchmarks, the boundary conditions can be classified into two major groups. The first group comprehends boundary conditions that preserve the information streaming from the bulk into boundary nodes and complete the missing information through closure relations. Boundary conditions in this group are found to be exceptionally accurate at low Reynolds number. Boundary conditions of the second group replace all variables on boundary nodes by new values. They exhibit generally much better numerical stability and are therefore dedicated for use in high Reynolds number flows.},

abstract = {It is known that the test of the capability of tritium self-sufficiency and the extraction of high-grade heat using tritium breeding blanket concepts is one of the major ITER missions. This requires the development of test blanket modules based on a corresponding DEMO blanket design, despite the differences in operating conditions between DEMO and ITER. Two blanket concepts such as a Helium-Cooled Solid Breeder (HCSB) blanket and a Helium-Cooled Molten Lithium (HCML) blanket are being considered as Korean Test Blanket Module (TBM) for ITER with the aim for verifying the capability of the breeding blanket design and manufacturability. In this paper, the current status of the design and analysis for the HCSB TBM is described. The key features of the design include the use of graphite neutron reflectors to reduce the amount of beryllium multiplier. Major analyses have been executed in order to optimize the design. The results of nuclear and thermo-hydraulic analysis show that the design parameters and requirements are satisfied. Also, the safety analysis results show that the design of the TBM system is sufficient to endure several accident events. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The objective of the ITER TBM Program is to provide the first experimental data on the performance of the breeding blankets in the integrated fusion nuclear environment. Such information is essential to design and predict the performance of DEMO and future fusion reactors. It foresees to test six mock-ups of breeding blankets, called Test Blanket Module (TBM), in three dedicated ITER equatorial ports from the beginning of the ITER operation. The TBM and its associated ancillary systems, including cooling system and tritium extraction system, forms the Test Blanket System (TBS) that will be fully integrated in the ITER machine and buildings. This paper describes the main features of the six TBSs that are presently planned for installation and operation in ITER, the main interfaces with other ITER systems and the main aspects of the TBM Program management. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, a good compatibility with structural materials is expected for the beryllides. In this study, a compatibility test between Be12Ti and SS316LN was carried out as first step to evaluate the compatibility between beryllides and structural materials. The thickness of the reaction layer between Be12Ti and SS316LN at 800 ??C after 1000 h was approximately 30 ??m, whereas that of beryllium metal was 300 ??m. At 600 ??C after 1000 h, the thickness of the reaction layers as to Be12Ti and Be was less than 10 and 100 ??m, respectively. The compatibility between Be12Ti and SS316LN was evaluated and Be12Ti was perfectly better than that between beryllium metal and SS316LN at high temperature (600-800 ??C). The advantage of beryllides as a neutron multiplier in the Demo reactor was proved. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Greenwood1966,
abstract = {It is usually assumed that the real area of contact between two nominally flat metal surfaces is determined by the plastic deformation of their highest asperities. This leads at once to the result that the real area of contact is directly proportional to the load and independent of the apparent area-a result with many applications in the theories of electric contacts and friction. Archard pointed out that plastic deformation could not be the universal rule, and introduced a model which showed that, contrary to earlier ideas, the area of contact could be proportional to the load even with purely elastic contact. This paper describes a new theory of elastic contact, which is more closely related to real surfaces than earlier theories. We show how the contact deformation depends on the topography of the surface, and establish the criterion for distinguishing surfaces which touch elastically from those which touch plastically. The theory also indicates the existence of an 'elastic contact hardness', a composite quantity depending on the elastic properties and the topography, which plays the same role in elastic contact as the conventional hardness does in plastic contact. A new instrument for measuring surface topography has been built; with it the various parameters shown by the theory to govern surface contact can be measured experimentally. The typical radii of surface asperities have been measured. They were found, surprisingly, to be orders of magnitude larger than the heights of the asperities. More generally we have been able to study the distributions of asperity heights and of other surface features for a variety of surfaces prepared by standard techniques. Using these data we find that contact between surfaces is frequently plastic, as usually assumed, but that surfaces which touch elastically are by no means uncommon in engineering practice.},

abstract = {The compatibility under irradiation of beryllium with Li2O, LiAlO2, Li4SiO4 and Li2ZrO3 ceramics and with 316L and 1.4914 steels was investigated in SIBELIUS. The irradiation was performed in the SILOE reactor at 550°C for 1690 h in He + 0.1{\%} H2 purge gas. Examinations of the LiAlO2/Be and Li2ZrO3/Be couples show a weak oxidation of beryllium and the presence of cavities near the interface with ceramics. Examinations of the 316L/Be and 1.4914/Be couples show the formation of an oxide layer on all beryllium and steel surfaces suggesting that corrosion arises from a species (most likely T2O and/or H2O) present in the environmental atmosphere. Postirradiation annealing tests of beryllium indicate that the major part of helium is released during irradiation whereas the major part of tritium is released above 700°C.},

@article{Shipway1997,
abstract = {Results are presented of a theoretical and experimental study of the fracture of single brittle spheres by uniaxial compression between opposed platens and by free impact against plane targets. The stress distributions in elastic spheres are broadly similar under both types of loading, with significant tensile components inside the sphere on the axis of the system and on the surface of the sphere, around the equator for the case of compression. The magnitudes and locations of the peak values of these stresses depend on the size of the contact area (relative to the size of the sphere), which in turn depends on the mechanical properties of the target and platen material. A simple equation used by previous investigators to estimate the maximum internal tensile from the load provides a useful approximation only under certain conditions, and more generally leads to significant error. Experiments with lead glass spheres have shown that under many conditions of compression and impact testing, failure initiates on the surface, rather than internally, at a critical value of tensile stress. The work is relevant to the breakage attrition of brittle particles in powder transport, handling and processing, and also to comminution. It also provides a basis for the interpretation of indirect tensile tests in which spherical samples are uniaxially compressed.},

The numerical modeling is based on the micro-mechanics displacement method in conjunction with an iterative process of successive releasing of the contact force of particles. Initial and final packed states for particle assembly and the contact forces for particles have been studied. In addition, a test article has been constructed to measure the thermal stress induced by the thermal expansion of the solid particle and to estimate the characteristic properties of particle materials. Corresponding experiments are carried out with aluminum and Li 2ZrO 3 pebble beds. Empirical correlations for the moduli of deformation are presented. These experiment data are compared with the numerical modeling results.},

abstract = {The pressure drop of technical devices is a crucial property for their design and operation. In this paper, we show how the results of lattice Boltzmann simulations can be used in science and engineering to improve the physical understanding of the pressure drop and the flow inhomogeneities in porous media, especially in sphere-packed fixed-bed reactors with low aspect ratios. Commonly used pressure drop correlations are based on simplified assumptions such as the capillary or tortuosity model, which do not reflect all hydrodynamic effects. Consequently, empirical correlations for certain classes of media have been introduced in the past to bridge the gap between the models and the experimental findings. As is shown in this paper by the detailed analysis of the velocity field in the void space of packed beds, the pressure drop is due to more complex hydrodynamics than considered in the above-mentioned models. With the help of lattice Boltzmann simulations, we were able to analyse the different contributions to the total dissipation, namely shear and deformation of the fluid, for different geometries over a wide range of Reynolds numbers. We further show that the actual length of the flow paths changes considerably with the radial and circumferential position.},

Properties of Be-Ti alloys have been found to be better than those of beryllium metal. In particular, steam interaction of a Be-Ti alloy was about 1/1000 as small as that of beryllium metal.

abstract = {Lithium metatitanate (Li2TiO3) is a candidate tritium breeding material for fusion reactor blankets. In an actual blanket the pebbles are geometrically confined in a containing structure subjected to displacement and stress constraints under operating conditions. For an accurate description of pebble behavior during operations, existing data of pebble deformation under compressive loads is inadequate. In this study a uniaxial compression experimental apparatus was built to investigate time dependent creep on a single pebble as a function of applied force and temperature relevant to blanket conditions. Experimental results shows that at a temperature range of 700-800 °C, the crush load of Li2Ti03 pebbles is reduced by about half of its room temperature crush load. The experimental results allow for the establishment of a pebble creep failure map as a function of force and temperature, which provides guidance to the blanket designs. The study also introduces an FEA model based on experimental deformation data to obtain the constitutive equation needed for Discrete Element Model simulation of the pebble bed.},

abstract = {An analysis, with experimental results, for the transient response of a packed bed thermal storage unit is presented. The analysis is in two spatial dimensions and considers the influence of both axial and radial thermal dispersion for arbitrary time and radial variations in the inlet fluid temperature. Both charging and recovery modes are included. Spatial variations in void fraction are found to have significant influence on the dynamic response of both fluid and solid temperatures. An unconditionally stable numerical model is developed that predicts the two-dimensional transient response of both solid and fluid phases. The influence of radial velocity variations, wall heat capacity and wall thermal losses are considered. The analysis is valid for fluids of various Prandtl numbers. Experimental measurements of temperature distributions in a randomly packed bed of uniform spheres, with air as the working fluid, compare favorably with the analytical results over a broad range of Reynolds numbers. Results are presented for full-size rock beds which indicate pronounced effects of void distribution in such systems.},

abstract = {With an extended lumped capacitance method applied to account for the internal heat conduction resistance in a solid (for Biot number larger than 0.1), a general model of thermal energy storage with various solid-fluid structural combinations is presented and verified using numerical results. The thermal energy storage system has a heat transfer fluid (HTF) flowing through a packed bed of solid materials structured in different configurations, such as in the form of solid pebbles, parallel plates, solid rod-bundles, or solids with fluid tubes imbedded through them. The model of energy conservation in the liquid and solid is transient, one-dimensional in nature, due to the introduction of a modified lumped capacitance method that counts for the effect of three-dimensional heat conduction in the solid structures. The computational workload using this modified model is significantly less compared to that of a comprehensive CFD analysis. Numerical results obtained from a CFD analysis of the thermal energy storage in the solid and liquid are used to verify the model. The CFD simulated results of temperatures of HTF are compared with the 1D model results, and they show excellent agreement. In conclusion, the 1D model is recommended as a convenient and accurate tool for general analysis and sizing of thermal energy storage containers that have various solid-fluid structural combinations. ?? 2014 .},

abstract = {In the simulation of pebble flow in Pebble-Bed High Temperature Reactors (PB-HTR's), high-fidelity methods, such as discrete element method (DEM), are usually employed to simulate the dynamic process of the pebble circulation. Such simulation normally takes extraordinarily long time to reach the dynamic equilibrium state, in which the pebble distribution is statistically steady. However, if an initial dense packing of pebbles can be provided, which is close to the realistic packing at the equilibrium state and can be easily implemented without much computational effort, then the high-fidelity pebble flow simulation can take much less time to reach the dynamic equilibrium state. In this paper, a collective dynamics-based method is developed to generate an initial pebble packing for the subsequent high-fidelity pebble flow simulations. In the new method, pebbles are packed by two processes: a sequential generation process allowing overlaps and an overlap elimination process based on a simplified normal contact force model. The latter provides an adaptive and efficient mechanism to eliminate the overlaps accounting for different overlap size and pebble size, thus can pack tens of thousands of pebbles within several minutes. Applications of the new method to packing pebbles in both cylindrical and annular core geometries are studied for two types of PB-HTR designs: HTR-10 and PBMR-400. The resulting packings show similar radial and axial packing fraction distributions compared to the dynamic equilibrium packing state produced by the DEM pebble flow simulation. Comparisons with other existing random packing methods, such as the gravitational deposition method, have shown that the developed method not only exhibits excellent computation efficiency, but also presents desirable potential in other applications as a general packing algorithm for packing mono-sized or poly-sized spheres in a large container. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {One of the European blanket designs for ITER is the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) blanket. The core of the HCPB-TBM consists of so-called breeder units (BUs), which encloses beryllium as neutron multiplier and lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) as tritium breeder in form of pebble beds. After the design phase of the HCPB-BU, a non-nuclear thermal and thermo-mechanical qualification program for this device is running at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Before the complex full scale BU testing, a pre-test mock-up experiment (PREMUX) has been constructed, which consists of a slice of the BU containing the Li4SiO4 pebble bed. PREMUX is going to be operated under highly ITER-relevant conditions and has the following goals: (1) as a testing rig of new heater concept based on a matrix of wire heaters, (2) as benchmark for the existing finite element method (FEM) codes used for the thermo-mechanical assessment of the Li4SiO 4 pebble bed, and (3) in situ measurement of thermal conductivity of the Li4SiO4 pebble bed during the tests. This paper describes the construction of PREMUX, its rationale and the experimental campaign planned with the device. Preliminary results testing the algorithm used for the temperature reconstruction of the pebble bed are reported and compared qualitatively with first analyses completed with the FEM codes. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The on-going need to improve design or scale-up of particulate solids processes, may it be handling, storage, transport or prediction of nature's phenomena, led to the use of the Discrete Element Method (DEM) which can help to develop a fundamental understanding of the particulates' behaviour. The interest is often focused on the particle trajectories, bulk structure, forces and velocities. Research and reviews were carried out on theoretical treatments and applications of DEM, DEM coupled with CFD or in comparison to continuum modelling. Whatever DEM code or contact model is chosen, an elasticity parameter such as the Young's modulus, the shear modulus or yet the loading/unloading stiffness is implemented. The elasticity parameter not only accounts for the deformation behaviour but also for the time step. Concerning the latter one the elasticity is often reduced to lower the running time of a simulation. Our review on the influence of these elasticity parameters on numerical results revealed that in pure numerical studies the elasticity is often reduced, neglecting any probable change of numerical response. However, we also found that awareness of the importance of the elasticity has increased lately.This study is part of the PARDEM research network: www.pardem.eu.},

abstract = {The behaviour of powder compacts is modelled by explicitly introducing the possibility of plastic loading, elastic unloading and decohesion at contacts. The study is limited to cold compaction and to perfectly plastic materials for which the analysis of Mesarovic and Johnson (J. Mech. Phys. 48 (2000) 2009) is used. We model the compact behaviour both with an analytical approach based upon a mean field assumption and with the discrete element method (DEM) that allows force equilibrium to be treated in a realistic manner. Using these two approaches, we are able to predict the effective elastic properties of a powder compact at the onset of unloading. The knowledge of the conditions that lead to decohesion at the contact scale is used to model the fracture of the powder compact (green strength). It is shown that, in first approximation, green strength is inversely proportional to the size of the powder particles. The two methods are used to generate failure and yield surfaces for axisymmetric conditions. Both isostatic and close die conditions are studied. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A correlation of the type$\epsilon$cr=A exp−BT$\sigma$ptnwas established. Compared to ceramic breeder materials, beryllium pebble beds are characterised by larger creep strains (by a factor 5–10) for given creep parameter values. For blanket conditions, these differences are smaller because characteristic temperatures are lower for beryllium than for the breeder material. For relatively short creep time periods, this factor is about 2–3. With these results, a complete set of data exists, required as input for codes used for the description of the thermal–mechanical interaction of solid breeder and beryllium pebble beds with the structural material of blanket elements.},

abstract = {Tortuosity ({\$}T{\$}) is a parameter describing an average elongation of fluid streamlines in a porous medium as compared to free flow. In this paper several methods of calculating this quantity from lengths of individual streamlines are compared and their weak and strong features are discussed. An alternative method is proposed, which enables one to calculate {\$}T{\$} directly from the fluid velocity field, without the need of determining streamlines, which greatly simplifies determination of tortuosity in complex geometries, including those found in experiments or 3D computer models. Numerical results obtained with this method suggest that (a) the hydraulic tortuosity of an isotropic fibrous medium takes on the form {\$}T = 1 + p\backslashsqrt{\{}1-\backslashphi{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashphi{\$} is the porosity and {\$}p{\$} is a constant and (b) the exponent controlling the divergence of {\$}T{\$} with the system size at percolation threshold is related to an exponent describing the scaling of the most probable traveling length at bond percolation.},

abstract = {We quantitatively evaluate the capability and accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann equation (LBE) for modeling flow through porous media. In particular, we conduct a comparative study of the LBE models with the multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) and the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) single-relaxation-time (SRT) collision operators. We also investigate several fluid-solid boundary conditions including: (1) the standard bounce-back (SBB) scheme, (2) the linearly interpolated bounce-back (LIBB) scheme, (3) the quadratically interpolated bounce-back (QIBB) scheme, and (4) the multi-reflection (MR) scheme. Three-dimensional flow through two porous media-a body-centered cubic (BCC) array of spheres and a random-sized sphere-pack-are examined in this study. For flow past a BCC array of spheres, we validate the linear LBE model by comparing its results with the nonlinear LBE model. We investigate systematically the viscosity-dependence of the computed permeability, the discretization error, and effects due to the choice of relaxation parameters with the MRT and BGK schemes. Our results show unequivocally that the MRT-LBE model is superior to the BGK-LBE model, and interpolation significantly improves the accuracy of the fluid-solid boundary conditions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Discrete Element Method (DEM) can help to obtain detailed information on the mixing process within a bed of fuel particles on grate firing systems. In a first study it was shown by comparing experiments on a generic grate with DEM simulations that for a granulate consisting of monodisperse spheres the influence of grate stroke length and bar velocity can be reproduced. Prior to tackling particle assemblies which are polydisperse and consist of particles of complex shape it has to be shown that the influence of particle diameter and material properties of the particles is described correctly by DEM simulations. Thus experiments with monodisperse spheres of three different diameters (5, 10, 20. mm) and two materials (plastic, wood) are compared to DEM simulations. The mixing process is measured at the front side wall and at the top surface of the particle bed and quantified by image analysis. Both visual observation and mixing parameter results attest a very good agreement between experiments and simulations. The influence of particle diameter and material properties measured in the experiments can be reproduced by DEM simulations. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Compaction characteristics of granular materials subjected to axial loading are investigated for both sphere and non-sphere granular assemblies. The computational study is based on the discrete element method (DEM). The compressive stress-strain relation obtained from three-dimensional DEM simulations is compared with that of an idealized two-dimensional plane-strain compression test and physical experiments using a bronze sphere assembly. We observed good agreement between the experimental and three-dimensional DEM simulation results, while two-dimensional simulations significantly underestimate the stiffness of particulate bed, particularly at large strains. This demonstrates that two-dimensional analysis is generally inadequate to model the compaction characteristics of granular systems. We performed a detailed analysis on the force-transmission characteristics of granular materials at microscopic level and present a connection between the directional orientation of force-networks and the invariants of the macroscopic stress tensor: the non-sphere systems were able to build up a strongly anisotropic network of heavily loaded contacts. Several complex phenomena, both geometric and kinematic, that are operative in sphere and non-sphere assemblies due to inter-particle interactions during compression are presented here. It is often assumed that the ratio of invariants of the stress tensor is uniform and constant in uni-axial compression tests. Our results show that the ratio of invariants of the stress tensor is non-uniform and non-constant even when the granular assemblies are subjected to the so-called uni-axial compressive loading, which is in agreement with other recent studies (e.g. Gu et al 2001 Int. J. Plasticity 17 147) performed using the finite element method. The non-homogeneous characteristics that are reported at the particulate scale need to be accounted in considering possible continuum models for the granular systems.},

Simulation was performed using a numerical code (modified SAFIRE code) by modifying SAFIRE ver.1 of Mikami, Kamiya and Horio (1998, Chemical Engineering Science, 53, 1927-1940) by incorporating the energy balance and the reaction rate. Heat transfer from a particle to gas was estimated using the Ranz-Marshall equation. The reaction rates were calculated by Arrenius type zero-th order kinetic expressions including the effect of catalyst weight. Hot spot formation at the bottom corner immediately above the perforated plate distributor was observed even when an equal amount of monomer gas was fed to all orifices. When the gas was not uniformly supplied, rather stable particle swirls formed in the bed creating a hot spot at the core of each swirl. The degree of mixing was found an effective parameter to predict the hot spot formation.},

The results show that large deformations due to induced thermal stresses are present during the first heat cycle but afterward are accommodated by a combination of pebble re-arrangement within the bed and thermally induced creep deformation. Initial results of a numerical simulation of the experiments using a finite element code that includes creep deformation is also presented.

abstract = {The Discrete Element Method (DEM) is useful for modelling granular flow. The accuracy of DEM modelling is dependent upon the model parameter values used. Determining these values remains one of the main challenges. In this study a method for determining the parameters of cohesionless granular material is presented. The particle size and density were directly measured and modelled. The particle shapes were modelled using two to four spheres clumped together. The remaining unknown parameter values were determined using confined compression tests and angle of repose tests. This was done by conducting laboratory experiments followed by equivalent numerical experiments and iteratively changing the parameters until the laboratory results were replicated. The modelling results of the confined compression tests were mainly influenced by the particle stiffness. The modelling results of the angle of repose tests were dependent on both the particle stiffness and the particle friction coefficient. From these observations, the confined compression test could be used to determine the particle stiffness and with the stiffness known, the angle of repose test could be used to determine the particle friction coefficient. Usually DEM codes do not solve the equations of motion for so-called walls (non-granular structural elements). However, in this study a dynamic model of a dragline bucket is developed and implemented in a commercial DEM code which allows the dynamics of the walls to be modelled. The DEM modelling of large systems of particles is still a challenge and procedures to simplify and speed up the modelling of dragline bucket filling are presented. Using the calibrated parameters, numerical results of bucket filling are compared to experimental results. The model accurately predicted the orientation of the bucket. The model also accurately predicted the drag force over the first third of the drag, but predicted drag forces too high for the subsequent part of the drag. ?? 2009 ISTVS.},

Uniaxial compression tests with Li4SiO4 pebble beds were performed in temperatures between ambient and 900°C and pressures up to 8 MPa. Corresponding experiments with a smaller parameter variation were carried out with Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3, and Li2O pebble beds. Empirical correlations for the moduli of deformation are presented for the different materials and first relationships for thermal creep of Li4SiO4 pebble beds are given. Using a different test facility, uniaxial tests were carried out with monosized and binary beryllium pebble beds in a temperature range between ambient and 480°C and pressures up to 8 MPa. Again, relationships for the deformation modulus are presented.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {In the frame of the activities of the EU Breeder Blanket Programme and of the Test Blanket Working Group of ITER, the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB TBM) is developed in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) to investigate DEMO relevant concepts for blanket modules. The three main functions of a blanket module (removing heat, breeding tritium and shielding sensitive components from radiation) will be tested in ITER using a series of four TBMs, which are irradiated successively during different test campaigns. Each HCPB TBM will be installed, with a vertical orientation, into the vacuum vessel connected to one equatorial port. As the studies performed up to 2006 in FZK concerned a horizontal orientation of the HCPB TBM, a global review of the design is necessary to match with the new ITER specifications. A preliminary version of the new vertical design is proposed extrapolating the neutronic analysis performed for the horizontal HCPB TBM. An overview of the new HCPB TBM vertical designs, as well as the preliminary thermal and fluid dynamic analyses performed for the validation of the design, are presented in this paper. A critical review of the results obtained allows us, in the conclusion, to prepare a plan for the future detailed analyses of the vertical HCPB TBM. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A thermal lattice Boltzmann model for natural convection in porous media under local thermal non-equilibrium conditions is proposed through an appropriate selection of equilibrium distribution functions and discrete source terms. In this model, two new distribution functions are introduced to simulate the temperature fields of the fluid and solid matrix phases in addition to the density distribution function for the velocity field. The macroscopic energy equations are recovered from the corresponding lattice Boltzmann equations by the Chapman-Enskog procedure. Detailed numerical tests of the proposed model are carried out for three different cases under both steady state and transient conditions. The influence of various parameters such as ratio of solid-to-fluid thermal conductivities, interstitial Nusselt number, Rayleigh number, and Darcy number on the thermal and flow fields is investigated. The present numerical results agree well with the solutions reported in previous studies. Therefore, it is verified that the present model can be served as a feasible and efficient tool for non-equilibrium natural convection problems in porous media. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The new axisymmetric lattice Boltzmann model is used to calculate the fluid flow and heat transfer characteristics in a pipe filled with porous media. The proposed algorithm is implemented on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) using NVIDIA's CUDA for a high calculating speed. Finally, the effects of several parameters, such as porous layer thickness, Darcy number and porosity, on thermal conductivity efficiency are investigated. It is found that controlling the thickness of the porous media can significantly improve heat transfer performance and the influence of porosity is very small both on flow field and temperature field when other parameters are fixed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {It is shown for the first time that the gradient diffusion hypothesis often adopted for thermal dispersion heat flux in heat transfer within porous media can be derived from a transport equation for the thermal dispersion heat flux based on the Navier–Stokes and energy equations. The transport equation valid for both thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium cases is mathematically modelled so that all unknown spatial correlation terms, associated with redistribution and dissipation of the dispersion heat flux, are expressed in terms of determinable variables. The unknown coefficients are determined analytically by considering of macroscopically unidirectional flow through a tube as treated by Taylor. Taylor's expression for the dispersion has been generated from the transport equation. Both laminar and turbulent flow cases are investigated to obtain two distinct limiting expressions for low- and high-P{\'{e}}clet-number regimes. The results obtained for the Taylor diffusion problem are translated to the case of heat and fluid flow in a packed bed, to obtain the corresponding expressions for the axial dispersion coefficient in a packed bed. The resulting expression for the high-P{\'{e}}clet-number case agrees well with the empirical formula, validating of the present transport analysis.},

abstract = {Since 1997, beryllide application as the neutron multiplier has been proposed in Japan and preliminary investigations revealed that some beryllides such as Be12Ti have excellent properties compared with beryllium metal. Recently, several international R{\&}D programs were performed. Some pebbles of modified Be12Ti that included the Be phase were obtained by the rotating electrode method. Basic characterization using HIPped Be 12Ti has also been performed. Preliminary experiments indicate that compatibility with stainless steel and tritium breeder materials, deuterium release, natural oxidation and oxidations by steam interaction were better than the behavior of beryllium. Preliminary neutron irradiation effects were studied in JMTR and by charged particle irradiation. It was observed that Be 12Ti has less radiation damage than beryllium. In a future experiment, Japanese Be12Ti samples will be included in a long European irradiation program on beryllium to produce up to 6000 appm He. This is an IEA collaborative experiment, to evaluate neutron irradiation effects. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Among the candidate tritium breeders, lithium titanate ( Li 2 TiO 3 ) is regarded as one of the best materials because of many advantages, reasonable lithium atom density, low activation, excellent tritium release characteristic at low temperature, compatibility with structural materials, reprocessing, etc. However, only limited data on the thermal and mechanical characteristics of Li 2 TiO 3 have been obtained for breeder material selection and fusion blanket design. In this study, Li 2 TiO 3 pellets with three different densities, i.e., 73{\%}T.D., 83{\%}T.D. and 93{\%}T.D., were prepared. Then, the density dependence and the thermal hysteresis of their thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal expansion were investigated.},

Results of thermal creep experiments with Li4SiO4 pebble beds (pebble diameters between 0.25 and 0.63 mm) are reported, performed in an uniaxial test facility at temperatures up to 850 °C and pressures up to 9 MPa. A correlation has been developed which describes thermal creep strain as a function of temperature, pressure and time. The temperature influence is, as expected, quite pronounced, the stress influence, however, is very small compared with homogeneous materials. For future BSMI calculations the proposed correlation is recommended to be used together with a correlation for the modulus of deformation at ambient temperature.},

abstract = {We quantified the microstructural disorder of packed beds and correlated it with the resulting eddy dispersion. For this purpose we designed a set of bulk (unconfined) monodisperse random sphere packings with a systematic, protocol-dependent degree of microstructural heterogeneity, covering a porosity range from the random-close to the random-loose packing limit ($\epsilon$ = 0.366-0.46). With the precise knowledge of particle positions, size, and shape we conducted a Voronoi{\"{i}} tessellation of all packings and correlated the statistical moments of the Voronoi{\"{i}} volume distributions (standard deviation and skewness) with the porosity and the protocol-dependent microstructural disorder. The deviation of the Voronoi{\"{i}} volume distributions from the delta function of a crystalline packing describes the origin of short-range disorder of the investigated random packings. Eddy dispersion was simulated over a wide range of reduced velocities (0.5 ≤ $\nu$ ≤ 750) and analyzed with the comprehensive Giddings equation. Transient dispersion was found to correlate with the spatial scales of heterogeneity in the packings. The analysis of short-range disorder based on the Voronoi{\"{i}} volume distributions revealed a strong correlation with the short-range interchannel contribution to eddy dispersion, whereas transchannel dispersion was relatively little affected. The presented approach defines a strictly scientific route to the key morphology-transport relationships of current and future chromatographic supports, including their morphological reconstruction, statistical analysis, and the correlation with relevant transport phenomena. It also guides us in our understanding, comparison, and optimization of the diverse packing algorithms and protocols used in simulations and experimental studies.},

abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method has been successfully applied for the simulation of flow through porous media in the creeping regime. Its technical properties, namely discretization, straightforward implementation and parallelization, are responsible for its popularity. However, flow through porous media is not restricted to near zero Reynolds numbers since inertial effects play a role in numerous natural and industrial processes. In this paper we investigate the capability of the lattice Boltzmann method to correctly describe flow in porous media at moderate Reynolds numbers. The selection of the lattice resolution, the collision kernel and the boundary conditions becomes increasingly important and the challenge is to keep artifacts due to compressibility effects at a minimum. The lattice Boltzmann results show an accurate quantitative agreement with finite element method results and evidence the capability of the method to reproduce Darcy's law at low Reynolds numbers and Forchheimer's law at high Reynolds numbers.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an effective general numerical procedure for the accurate evaluation of the geometric view factors between equally sized spheres in a randomly packed assembly. The procedure is a novel combination of three key techniques: the Tanaka integral expression for the view factor between two equal spheres, the product form of the Fibonacci integration scheme for integrals on spheres, and the non-uniform variable scaling. The Tanaka integral not only provides a simple integral to numerically compute the exact value of the view factor between two unit spheres without a blockage, but also plays a fundamental role in improving the computed shaded view factor between two spheres subject to any blockage. The product Fibonacci integration scheme, essentially a ray-tracing method, appears to be a low cost but sufficiently accurate cubature for evaluating the dual-integral defining the view factor. The use of a particular non-uniform scaling function very favourably modulates the properties of the view factor integrals, and thus substantially improves the solution accuracy of the Fibonacci integration scheme. Several practical issues associated with the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure are discussed, and test cases are provided to illustrate the applicability of the procedure.},

@article{Yang2010b,
abstract = {Randomly packed bed reactors are widely used in chemical process industries, because of their low cost and ease of use compared to other packing methods. However, the pressure drops in such packed beds are usually much higher than those in other packed beds, and the overall heat transfer performances may be greatly lowered. In order to reduce the pressure drops and improve the overall heat transfer performances of packed beds, structured packed beds are considered to be promising choices. In this paper, the flow and heat transfer inside small pores of some novel structured packed beds are numerically studied, where the packed beds with ellipsoidal or non-uniform spherical particles are investigated for the first time and some new transport phenomena are obtained. Three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and RNG k-?? turbulence model with scalable wall function are adopted for present computations. The effects of packing form and particle shape are studied in detail and the flow and heat transfer performances in uniform and non-uniform packed beds are also compared with each other. Firstly, it is found that, with proper selection of packing form and particle shape, the pressure drops in structured packed beds can be greatly reduced and the overall heat transfer performances will be improved. The traditional correlations of flow and heat transfer extracted from randomly packings are found to overpredict the pressure drops and Nusselt number for all these structured packings, and new correlations of flow and heat transfer are obtained. Secondly, it is also revealed that, both the effects of packing form and particle shape are significant on the flow and heat transfer in structured packed beds. With the same particle shape (sphere), the overall heat transfer efficiency of simple cubic (SC) packing is the highest. With the same packing form, such as face center cubic (FCC) packing, the overall heat transfer performance of long ellipsoidal particle model is the best. Furthermore, with the same particle shape and packing form, such as body center cubic (BCC) packing with spheres, the overall heat transfer performance of uniform packing model is higher than that of non-uniform packing model. The models and results presented in this paper would be useful for the optimum design of packed bed reactors. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The radial variation of void fraction within a packed bed of uniform spheres has been found to vary from unity at the wall to about 38{\%} in the interior of large beds. The voidage distribution takes the form of a damped oscillatory wave with the oscillations damped out at about 4½ to 5 sphere diameters from the container wall. The distribution function is essentially independent of whether the container wall is concave or convex.Continuous surfaces within the bed are responsible for local voidage variations similar to those at the container wall.An improved experimental technique is described in detail. The results presented are for a number of cases with D/d varying from 2.6 to infinity, and for boundary walls which are concave and convex.},

The prediction of the conductance is based on the constriction resistance for spheres in contact. Both exact and approximate equations are derived for solid, hollow, and coated spheres and for several regular packing patterns of different void fractions. Comparisons with the available experimental data indicate that the theory is satisfactory over a wide range of applied load and system parameters.},

abstract = {In the temperature range from room temperature to 973 K and the mechanical loading range from 0.1 to 3 MPa, a Li2TiO3 pebble bed was successively loaded and the packing behaviour of the bed was observed. Deformation caused by the mechanical loading is partly relaxed when the bed is heated without the load. After a large numbers of thermal and mechanical loading cycles, the packing factor of the bed increased from the initial packing factor of 66.9{\%} to finally about 68.5{\%}. This progressive increase in packing leads to production of a cavity region at the top of the pebble bed, therefore it is important to obtain a high initial packing factor.},

@article{Zhao2013a,
abstract = {This paper presents a coupled Computational Fluid Dynamics and Discrete Element Method (CFD-DEM) approach to simulate the behaviour of fluid-particle interaction for applications relevant to mining and geotechnical engineering. DEM is employed to model the granular particle system, whilst the CFD is used to simulate the fluid flow by solving the locally averaged Navier-Stokes equation. The particle-fluid interaction is considered by exchanging such interaction forces as drag force and buoyancy force between the DEM and the CFD computations. The coupled CFD-DEM tool is first benchmarked by two classic geomechanics problems where analytical solutions are available, and is then employed to investigate the characteristics of sand heap formed in water through hopper flow. The influence of fluid-particle interaction on the behaviour of granular media is well captured in all the simulated problems. It is shown in particular that a sand pile formed in water is more homogeneous in terms of void ratio, contact force and fabric anisotropy. The central pressure dip of vertical stress profile at the base of sandpile is moderately reduced, as compared to the dry case. The effects of rolling resistance and polydispersity in conjunction with the presence of water on the formation of sandpile are also discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Majmudar2005,
abstract = {Interparticle forces in granular media form an inhomogeneous distribution of filamentary force chains. Understanding such forces and their spatial correlations, specifically in response to forces at the system boundaries, represents a fundamental goal of granular mechanics. The problem is of relevance to civil engineering, geophysics and physics, being important for the understanding of jamming, shear-induced yielding and mechanical response. Here we report measurements of the normal and tangential grain-scale forces inside a two-dimensional system of photoelastic disks that are subject to pure shear and isotropic compression. Various statistical measures show the underlying differences between these two stress states. These differences appear in the distributions of normal forces (which are more rounded for compression than shear), although not in the distributions of tangential forces (which are exponential in both cases). Sheared systems show anisotropy in the distributions of both the contact network and the contact forces. Anisotropy also occurs in the spatial correlations of forces, which provide a quantitative replacement for the idea of force chains. Sheared systems have long-range correlations in the direction of force chains, whereas isotropically compressed systems have short-range correlations regardless of the direction.},

On virtual work and stress in granular media. Int. J. Solids Struct. 42, 3773-3793]. The authors follow closely this debate and try, with this paper, to provide a platform where the various viewpoints could find their position. We consider an ensemble of rigid, arbitrarily shaped grains as a set with structure. We establish a basic mathematical framework which allows to express the balance laws and the action-reaction laws for the discrete system in a "global" form, through the concepts of "part", "granular surface", "separately additive function" and "flux". The independent variable in the balance laws is then the arbitrary part of the assembly rather than the single grain. A parallel framework is constructed for Cosserat continua, by applying the axiomatics established by [Noll, W., 1959. The foundation of classical mechanics in the light of recent advances in continuum mechanics. In: The axiomatic method, with special reference to Geometry and Physics, North-Holland Publishing Co., Amsterdam pp. 266-281, Gurtin, M.E., Williams, W.O., 1967.

The comparison between the two realisations suggests the microscopic interpretation for some features of Cosserat Mechanics, among which the asymmetry of the Cauchy-stress tensor and the couple-stress. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Tritium breeding materials, which have the ability to react with neutrons and produce tritium, are required to fuel fusion reactions. Tritium is produced inside the fusion blanket by neutron irradiation of lithium ceramics (tritium breeders). Using the lithium ceramics in form of pebbles-packed bed is a promising concept for fusion blankets, and worldwide efforts have been dedicated to its R{\&}D. Thermal properties of lithium ceramic pebble beds have a significant impact upon the thermal performance of the fusion blanket. Specifically, the effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds is important for the design and analysis of fusion blankets. The experimental apparatus of this study was designed and built based on the principles of the steady state and axial heat flow methods in order to conduct the required measurements. The objective of this study is to measure the effective thermal conductivity of a Li2TiO3 pebble bed as a function of the average bed temperature. The pebble bed has pebbles of 1.7-2.0 mm diameter and a packing fraction of 61{\%}. Helium at atmospheric pressure was used as a filling gas. The experimental results showed that the effective thermal conductivity decreased from 1.40 to 0.94 W/m K with the increase of the average bed temperature from 50 to 500 ??C. The results presented in this work will help to create a database of the effective thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pebble beds which can be used for the design and analysis of fusion blankets. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The unsteady fluid flow inside the complex geometry of an intracranial aneurysm during a cardiac cycle was simulated. The results obtained by several versions of a lattice Boltzmann based code were compared with the results of PIV and LDA measurements and with those of a commercial finite volume solver. The best version from the tested lattice Boltzmann codes was chosen for further comparisons and grid convergence measurement. It was shown that the lattice Boltzmann method is capable of producing results with an accuracy comparable to the finite volume solver in a 3D unsteady flow and also that the results are in good agreement with the experimental results. It was also shown that using a GPU implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method it is possible to significantly reduce the run-time length compared to the CPU only implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method.},

abstract = {The method of volume averaging is applied to the process of transient heat conduction in two- and three-phase systems, and a closure scheme is developed that allows for direct determination of the thermal conductivity tensor. Previous experimental studies have been extended to cover a wide range of parameters and for two-phase systems values of the effective thermal conductivity have been measured for conductivity ratios as high as $\kappa$ = k$\sigma$/k$\beta$ = 8000. Here k$\sigma$ is the conductivity of the discontinuous phase and k$\beta$ is the conductivity of the continuous phase. For large values of $\kappa$ a combined numerical and perturbation method was used to predict the effective thermal conductivity. Good agreement between theory and experiment is obtained; however, the particle-particle contact was treated in an empirical manner.},

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {This paper examined the features of three typical thermal storage systems including: 1) direct storage of heat transfer fluid in containers, 2) storage of thermal energy in a packed bed of solid filler material, with energy being carried in/out by a flowing heat transfer fluid which directly contacts the packed bed, and 3) a system in which heat transfer fluid flows through tubes that are imbedded into a thermal storage material which may be solid, liquid, or a mixture of the two. The similarity of the three types of thermal storage systems was discussed, and generalized energy storage governing equations were introduced in both dimensional and dimensionless forms. The temperatures of the heat transfer fluid during energy charge and discharge processes and the overall energy storage efficiencies were studied through solution of the energy storage governing equations. Finally, provided in the paper are a series of generalized charts bearing curves for energy storage effectiveness against four dimensionless parameters grouped up from many of the thermal storage system properties including dimensions, fluid and thermal storage material properties, as well as the operational conditions including mass flow rate of the fluid, and the ratio of energy charge and discharge time periods. Engineers can conveniently look up the charts to design and calibrate the size of thermal storage tanks and operational conditions without doing complicated individual modeling and computations. It is expected that the charts will serve as standard tools for thermal storage system design and calibration.},

The overall objective of the paper is to serve as an introduction to researchers and practitioners in geomechanics who are considering adopting DEM in their work or using the results of DEM simulations to guide other studies, for example, the development of constitutive models for continuum-based numerical analysis. It is hoped that prior converts to the use of DEM will also benefit from a relatively objective overview of current DEM use in geomechanics. The introductory sections present the background to the method and give an overview of the evolution of the use of particulate DEM in recent geotechnical research. The general principals of the algorithm are then presented, considering the types of particles typically used, the calculation of contact forces, and formulation of simulation boundary conditions.

abstract = {Detailed transient numerical simulations of fluid and heat flow were performed for a number of heat exchanger segments with cylindrical, ellipsoidal and wing-shaped tubes in a staggered arrangement. The purpose of the analysis was to get an insight of local heat transfer and fluid flow conditions in a heat exchanger and to establish widely applicable drag coefficient and Stanton number correlations for the heat exchanger integral model, based on average flow variables. The simulation results revealed much more complex flow behavior than reported in current literature. For each of the almost 100 analyzed cases, the time distributions of the Reynolds number, the drag coefficient and the Stanton number were recorded, and their average values calculated. Based on these average values, the drag coefficient and the Stanton number correlations were constructed as polynomial functions of the Reynolds number and the hydraulic diameter. The comparison of the collected results also allows more general conclusions on efficiency and stability of the heat transfer process in tube bundles. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Within a design study of a fusion DEMO reactor aiming at demonstrating technologies of fusion power plant. supercritical water is applied as a coolant of solid breeder blanket to attain high thermal efficiency. The blanket has multi-layer composed of solid breeder pebbles (Li2O) and neutron multiplier pebbles (Be) which are radially separated by cooling panels. The first wall and the breeding region are cooled by supercritical water below and above the pseudo-critical temperature, respectively. Temperature distribution and tritium breeding ratio (TBR) have been estimated by one-dimensional nuclear and thermal calculation,,. The local TBR as high as 1.47 ha, been obtained After optimization of temperature distribution in the breeder region under the following conditions: neutron wall loading of 5 MW/m(2), Li-6 enrichment of 30{\%} and coolant temperature at inlet of breeder region of 380degreesC. In the ease of the higher coolant temperature 430degreesC of the breeder region the local TBR was reduced to be 1.40. This means that the net TBR higher than 1.0 could be expected with the supercritical-water-cooled blanket, whose temperature distribution in the breeder region would be optimized by following the coolant temperature, and where a coverage of the breeder region is assumed to be 70{\%}.},

abstract = {We review recent developments in size separation in vibrated granular materials. Motivated by a need in industry to handle granular materials efficiently and a desire to make fundamental advances in non-equilibrium physics, experimental and theoretical investigations have shown size separation to be a complex phenomenon. Large particles in a vibrated granular system normally rise to the top. However, they may also sink to the bottom or show other patterns, depending on subtle variations in physical conditions. While size ratio is a dominant factor, particle-specific properties such as density, inelasticity and friction can play an important role. The nature of the energy input, boundary conditions and interstitial air have also been shown to be significant factors in determining spatial distributions. The presence of convection can enhance mixing or lead to size separation. Experimental techniques including direct visualization and magnetic resonance imaging are being used to investigate these properties. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been developed to probe size separation. Analytical methods such as kinetic theory are being used to study the interplay between particle size and density in the vibro-fluidized regime, and geometric models have been proposed to describe size separation for deep beds. Besides discussing these studies, we will also review the impact of inelastic collisions and friction on the density and velocity distributions to gain a deeper appreciation of the non-equilibrium nature of the system. While a substantial number of studies have been performed, considerable work is still required to achieve a firm description of the phenomena.},

A video camera and a thermographic system monitor the experiments. Because the particles show Biot numbers {\textgreater}. 1 the radial temperature distribution within the particle has been calculated by solving the unsteady one-dimensional differential equation for heat conduction in the DEM simulations. A visual comparison of the heat-up of the particles and particle transport within the bed shows a good agreement between simulations and experiments. In addition, local minimum, maximum and average particle surface temperatures in different layers of the particle bed are calculated. Experimentally measured temperature gradients over the particle bed height are in very good agreement to DEM/CFD simulations. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {An introduction is given to the lattice Boltzmann method and its background, with a view towards acoustic applications of the method. To make a larger range of acoustic applications possible, a point source method is proposed. This point source is applied to simulate cylindrical waves and plane waves, and is shown to give a very good nu- merical result compared with analytic solutions of viscously damped cylindrical and plane waves. Good results are found for simulations of Doppler effect, diffraction, and viscously damped standing waves. It is concluded that the lattice Boltzmann method could be suitable for simulating acoustics in complex flows, at ultrasound frequencies and very small spatial scales. The lattice Boltzmann method is shown to be unfeasible at lower frequencies or for larger systems.},

@article{Talon2012,
abstract = {The recent advances in 3-D imaging of porous structures have generated a tremendous interest in the simulation of complex single and two-phase flows. Lattice-Boltzmann (LB) schemes present a powerful tool to solve the flow field directly from the binarized 3-D images. However, as viscosity often plays an important role, the LB scheme should correctly treat viscosity effects. This is the case using a LB scheme with two relaxation times (TRT) unlike the broadly used, the single-relaxation rate, BGK, where the velocity of the modeled fluid does not vary as the inverse of the viscosity applying the bounce-back (no-slip) boundary rule. The aim of this work is to apply the LB-TRT approach to different types of porous media (straight channels, 2-D model porous media, sandstone) to solve for the flow field and to evaluate the approach in terms of parameter dependence, error and convergence time on the basis of permeability. We show that the variation of permeability with the free relaxation parameter of the TRT scheme depends on the heterogeneity of the sample and on the numerical resolution. The convergence time depends on the applied viscosity and the parameter standing for the speed of sound, thus the computation time can be reduced by choosing appropriate values of those parameters. Two approaches to calculate permeability (Darcy's law and viscous energy dissipation) are proposed and investigated. We recommend to use Darcy's law, as dependence on is less important. Periodic (in the presence of a driving body force) and pressure boundary conditions are evaluated in terms of the results. Copyright 2012 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Referring to the so called "fast-track" EU strategy, those concepts are intended to be tested in ITER, getting the maximum of information required for launching the DEMO blanket design and construction after the first 10 years of ITER operation. For that, the EU has adopted a blanket testing strategy based on the development of Test Blanket Modules (TBM) that are expected to use DEMO relevant technologies and are designed for each ITER plasma phase to optimize the added value of results and to avoid any impact on ITER availability. Prior to their insertion in ITER, EU is running a significant R{\&}D program for the development and qualification of HCLL and HCPB Test Blanket Modules, including at a later stage functional tests of integrated TBM mock-ups. ?? 2005 The European Commission.

This study estimates the effect of neutron multiplier materials and the effect of the packing configuration on the TBR of the SSTR-based blanket. This work shows that the tritium-breeding ratio (TBR) in a mixed type blanket is about 1.2 times greater than that of separated type blanket. This study shows that TBR of mixed type blanket using Be12Ti or Be 12V will be about 1.2 (required TBR is about 1.3), which is 90{\%} of the TBR for a mixed type blanket using Be.

Results of investigations show that materials do meet the B.I.T. requirements. Moreover, the excellent tritium release performance of Li2ZrO3 and Li2TiO3 designate these ceramics as promising materials for the ITER breeding blanket.},

abstract = {The thermal conductivity degradation due to low-temperature neutron irradiation is studied and quantified in terms of thermal resistance terms. Neutron irradiation is assumed to have no effect on umklapp scattering. A theoretical model is presented to quantify the relative phonon-scattering effectiveness of the three dominant defect types produced by neutron irradiation: point defects, dislocation loops and voids. Several commercial ceramics have been irradiated with fission reactor fast neutrons at low temperatures to produce defects. Materials include silicon carbide, sapphire, polycrystalline alumina, aluminum nitride, silicon nitride, beryllium oxide, and a carbon fiber composite. The neutron dose corresponded to 0.001 and 0.01 displacements per atom (dpa) for a ???60 ??C irradiation and 0.01 and 0.1 dpa for a ???300 ??C irradiation. Substantial thermal conductivity degradation occurred in all of the materials except BeO following irradiation at 60 ??C to a dose of only 0.001 dpa. The data are discussed in terms of the effective increase in thermal resistance caused by the different irradiation conditions. Evidence for significant point defect mobility during irradiation at 60 and 300 ??C was obtained for all of the ceramics. The thermal stability of the radiation defects was investigated by isochronal annealing up to 1050 ??C. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to the calculation of the effective thermal conductivity in packed pebble bed reactors, namely the Multi-sphere Unit Cell model. The model specifically accounts for the porous structure, which is characterised using the radial variation in porosity, coordination number and contact angles between adjacent spheres. It also accounts for solid and gas thermal conduction, contact area, surface roughness as well as the thermal radiation for pebble temperatures up to 1200??C. This more rigorous approach to characterising the porous structure enables improved prediction of the effective thermal conductivity in the near-wall and wall regions, resulting in better prediction of the temperatures at the reflector interface. Results obtained with the Multi-sphere Unit Cell model are compared with existing correlations and experimental data including those from the SANA-I experimental test facility. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In this investigation, a thermo-mechanical model for pebble beds and a method for the identification of the material parameters, recently developed in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, are adopted for the analysis of HE-FUS3 Lithium Cassette (HELICA) mock-up. A pressure-dependent thermal contact conductance model to represent the pebble–wall interactions has been implemented in the FE code ABAQUS. First, the current material model has been verified by uniaxial compression and creep experiments under a wide range of temperature fields, and good agreement between experiments and theory has been achieved. The HELICA mock-up has been modelled by 2D generalized plane strain elements, and analyzed in ABAQUS. The results show that the temperature and mechanical fields obtained in FE analysis agree well with the measurements by thermo-couples and LVDTs located at different positions.},

TiBe12 stands out from other beryllides for fusion because it has the highest neutron-multiplication characteristic, with the added benefit of higher temperature performance capability compared to beryllium metal. To date, little information has been available on the physical and mechanical properties of TiBe12 despite an extensive R{\&}D effort to characterize many beryllide intermetallic compounds in the U.S. from 1956 to 1970. This paper compiles data pertaining to TiBe12 which are taken from several reports written during the referenced time period. This important historical work, which until now has only existed in hard copy reports in private technical libraries, is summarized for current relevance and subsequently, made available in electronic format as a technical reference and basis for planning future work. ?? 2009.},

abstract = {Beryllides are expected to be used as the advanced neutron multiplier for the DEMO blanket owing to their peculiar properties like higher melting point, high oxidation resistance, etc. which can improve the blanket design. In this study, thermal conductivity of neutron irradiated Be12Ti was measured. The Be12Ti specimens were fabricated by HIP process using beryllium and titanium powder, and were irradiated in the JMTR up to a fast neutron fluence (E {\textgreater} 1 MeV) of 4 ?? 1020 n/cm2 at temperatures of 330, 400 and 500 ??C. Thermal diffusivity and specific heat of un-irradiated and irradiated specimens were measured up to 1000 ??C by laser flash method. Then, the thermal conductivity was evaluated from these data. The effective thermal conductivity in the pebble bed of fusion blanket was also estimated and interesting prospects for blanket design were obtained. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Reimann:2002kl,
abstract = {The thermomechanical interaction of solid breeder and beryllium pebble beds with structural material (BSMI) has been identified as a critical issue for solid breeder blanket designs. For example, the expansion of pebble beds restrained by blanket structure exerts stresses on the pebbles as well as the blanket structure wall, which might cause the pebbles to break and jeopardise the blanket operation. However, at elevated temperatures thermal creep will reduce these stresses and might compensate for stress build-up due to irradiation-induced swelling. A significant influence of irradiation on the pebble bed properties is expected. Computationally, the BSMI can be assessed in two ways: (i) by applying appropriate finite element codes combined with the description of modules for the pebble beds. As input, these modules require data on characteristic pebble bed properties determined in different standard-type tests; (ii) by numerical simulations based on a discrete numerical model. Here, the stress profiles are calculated while the effective modulus and bed thermal expansion coefficients are back estimated. In this paper, recent experimental results on thermomechanical pebble bed properties for ceramic breeder (metatitanate and orthosilicate) pebble beds and beryllium pebble beds are presented, including data on the moduli of deformation, thermal creep, inner friction angle, and thermal conductivity of deformed pebble beds. Furthermore, modelling results of the BSMI for simple geometries are reported based both on homogeneous and discrete models and are compared with experimental results.},

abstract = {In fusion reactors, Be is a candidate material for both ceramic breeder blankets in the form of pebbles and as plasma facing components (PFC) at the First Wall in the form of tiles. Beryllium intermetallic compounds (beryllides) were first investigated in the USA, looking for light-weight materials with high temperature performance. For the use in nuclear fusion reactor blankets, encouraging material data were obtained more recently in Japan for TiBe12 in respect to compatibility, reactivity with water, tritium release, and irradiation effects. Beryllides would be also of interest as PFC material if it could be shown that beryllides mitigate the Be erosion into the plasma. At present, the data base is far too small in order if beryllides could become candidate materials for these applications. In this paper, performance parameters are listed and material data for TiBe12 and VBe12 are compiled including new experimental results obtained with a TiBe12 sample, produced by GVT, and a VBe12 sample, provided by Brush Wellman Inc.},

The six parameters are the temperature distribution along the height of the storage tank at different time intervals, the charging energy efficiency, the charging exergy efficiency, the stratification number, the Reynolds number and the Richardson number. These parameters are evaluated under six different experimental charging conditions. Temperature distribution along the height of the storage tank at different time intervals and the stratification number are parameters found to describe thermal stratification quantitatively adequately. On the other-hand, the charging exergy efficiency and the Reynolds number give important information about describing thermal stratification qualitatively and should be used with care. The charging energy efficiency and the Richardson number have no clear relationship with thermal stratification.},

abstract = {The effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds is an important parameter for the thermomechanical design of solid breeder blankets operating at temperatures of up to 900 °C in breeder pebble beds and up to 700 °C in beryllium pebble beds. Compressive stresses and creep might cause significant pebble deformations. The knowledge of the thermal conductivity as a function of bed deformation, therefore, is of prime importance. For strongly deformed pebble beds, only results for beryllium pebbles existed where the conductivity increased by a factor of about 5 for bed deformations of about 1{\%}. For ceramic breeder beds, the increase of the bed conductivity with increasing bed deformation is expected to be much smaller. Quantitative results were missing. This paper presents results on the thermal conductivity of lithium orthosilicate and different types of lithium metatitanate pebble beds (monsized and binary beds) for bed deformations up to 4.5{\%} and temperatures up to 800 °C using the pulsed hot wire technique. Most of the measurements at high temperatures were performed in air; at ambient temperature, helium and argon were also used. A distinct increase of the thermal conductivity with bed deformation was found: however, this effect is quite small compared to deformed beryllium beds and might be neglected at high temperatures. The results for zero bed deformation agree well with correlations from literature.},

abstract = {Traditional models of transport in packed beds assume that the velocity$\backslash$nacross the reactor is uniform, even along the solid surfaces. Because$\backslash$nof the velocity-slip assumption, corresponding convection studies$\backslash$nfor inert beds rely on a temperature-slip boundary condition to predict$\backslash$nexperimental data. For reacting beds, the transport process is more$\backslash$ncomplex; however, the analysis is simplified using the temperature-slip$\backslash$nheat transfer coefficients determined under non-reacting conditions.$\backslash$nSince the heat transfer rates differ between reacting and inert beds,$\backslash$nconsiderable discrepancies often exist between predicted results$\backslash$nand experimental measurements. Furthermore, using the boundary conditions$\backslash$nfrom inert beds precludes the determination of the actual wall heat$\backslash$ntransfer for catalytic reactions. The present non-Darcian analysis$\backslash$nassumes a porosity variation near the wall and solves the governing$\backslash$nmomentum equation satisfying that noslip boundary condition. The$\backslash$ncorresponding heat transfer solutions use the wall-temperature boundary$\backslash$ncondition and hence can predict cooling rates when chemical reactions$\backslash$nare included. The analysis yields results that agree with existing$\backslash$nexperimental data.},

abstract = {If a liquid, initially at uniform temperature, passes lengthwise through a right, porous prism, initially at some other uniform temperature, the sides of the prism being adiabatic and impervious to the liquid, then the temperatures of both liquid and solid will be functions of the time and of a distance. The problem of finding the temperature distributions has been solved assuming the well-known laws governing the transfer of heat from a liquid in turbulent motion to a solid. The solution as presented involves the use of some interesting mathematical functions which are related to the well-known Bessel Functions. If a gas is used instead of a liquid, the problem is much more complicated, but a dimensional method of treating the problem leads to results which may be very useful in practice. The author wishes to express his thanks and appreciation to Dr. S. Y. Burke for suggesting this research and showing such a stimulating interest during its development, and also to the Combustion Utilities Corporation for permission to publish the results.},

abstract = {An analytical solution to the transient thermal behavior of a rock-bed thermal storage system subjected to varying air inlet temperature is presented. The solution is obtained in terms of infinite double series which are based on Schumann's solution, derived for a step change in air inlet temperature. In the present study, bed and fluid temperatures in response to arbitrary fluid inlet temperatures are calculated by means of Duhamel's theorem. Results of this study were verified experimentally and compared to a numerical solution. Agreement in both these cases was very good. Pressure drop data were compared to values predicted by two previously published correlations. These correlations were found to underpredict the measured data by factors in the range 1.5-5. Reasons for this discrepancy are mainly due to the differences in the type and particularly the shapes of rocks used in the different studies.},

abstract = {Followed by the numerical study of Yang et al. (2010), the macroscopic hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics in some novel structured packed beds are experimentally studied in this paper, where the packings of ellipsoidal or non-uniform spherical particles are investigated for the first time with experiments and some important results are obtained. For present experiments, the interstitial heat transfer coefficient in the packed bed is determined using an inverse method of transient single-blow technique. The effects of packing form and particle shape are carefully investigated and the experimental and numerical results (Yang et al., 2010) are also compared in detail. Firstly, it is discovered that, the computational method reported by Yang et al. (2010) might be appropriate for heat transfer predictions in structured packings, while it might underestimate the friction factors, especially when the porosity is relatively low. Secondly, it is found that, the traditional Ergun's and Wakao's equations might overpredict the friction factors and Nusselt numbers for the structured packings, respectively, and some experimental modified correlations are obtained. Furthermore, it is also revealed that, both the effects of packing form and particle shape are significant to the macroscopic hydrodynamic and heat transfer characteristics in structured packed beds. With proper selection of packing form, such as simple cubic packing (SC) and particle shape, such as ellipsoidal particle, the pressure drops in the structured packed beds can be greatly reduced and the overall heat transfer performances will be improved. These experimental results would be reliable and useful for the optimum design in industry applications. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Through the Chapman-Enskog procedure, the generalized Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible flow in porous media are derived from the present lattice Boltzmann model. The generalized two-dimensional Poiseuille flow, Couette flow, and lid-driven cavity flow are simulated using the present model.

Our analysis shows that TES can increase the value of CSP by allowing more thermal energy from a CSP plant's solar field to be used, by allowing a CSP plant to accommodate a larger solar field, and by allowing CSP generation to be shifted to hours with higher energy prices. We analyze the sensitivity of CSP value to a number of factors, including the optimization period, price and solar forecasting, ancillary service sales, capacity value and dry cooling of the CSP plant. We also discuss the value of CSP plants and TES net of capital costs.},

abstract = {The discrete element method (DEM) is a promising approach to model machine-granular material interaction. The accuracy of DEM models depends on the model parameters. In this study a calibration process is developed to determine the parameter values. Laboratory shear tests and compressions tests are used to determine the material internal friction angle and stiffness, respectively. These tests are repeated numerically using DEM models with different sets of particle friction coefficients and particle stiffness values. The shear test results are found to be dependent on both the particle friction coefficient and the particle stiffness. The compression test results show that it is only dependent on the particle stiffness. The combination of shear test and compression test results can be used to determine a unique set of particle friction and particle stiffness values. The calibration process is validated by modelling silo discharge and bucket filling. It is shown that DEM can accurately predict the silo discharge rate and flow patterns. It is also shown that DEM can predict bucket forces, fill rates and fill patterns. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Lattice Boltzmann (LB) methods are used to simulate hydrodynamics, reaction and subsequent mass transfer in a disordered packed bed of catalyst particles at sub-pore length-scales. In contrast to previous studies, a variety of modifications are introduced in the LB method enabling particle Pe numbers up to 108, and hence realistic values of diffusivity, to be accessed. These include decoupling the hydrodynamics from mass transfer and the use of a rest fraction in the LB formulation of mass transfer. In addition the mass transfer simulations are modified to permit spatially varying values of diffusivity, essential to differentiate between intra- and inter-particle diffusivity (Dintra and Dinter, respectively). The simulation method is applied to both a disordered and ordered 2D packing for a range of Pe (15.6-1557.8) and Re (0.16-1.56) numbers, as well as various ratios of Dintra/Dinter (0-1), whilst simulating an esterfication reaction catalyzed by an ion-exchange resin. The value of Dintra is found to have limited effect, whilst reducing Pe number results in a considerable increase in overall conversion.

Flows are investigated for Peclet (Pe) and Reynolds (Re) numbers in the range 182 {\textless} Pe {\textless} 350 and 0.4 {\textless} Re {\textless} 077, respectively. An MRI visualization of the 3-D packing of spheres for which NMR data are obtained is used as the matrix for the simulation, thereby enabling a direct assessment of the ability of the lattice-Boltzmann method to quantitatively predict flow phenomena within porous media of complex geometry. By introducing normalized parameters, hydrodynamical dispersion over normalized displacement lengthscales extending over nearly four orders of magnitude is investigated and is shown to be dominated by mechanical dispersion over most of this range. At the largest lengthscales studied holdup may play a significant role in the hydrodynamics characteristic of the porous medium. Quantitative agreement between NMR measurements and the predictions of the lattice-Boltzmann simulation is obtained in all cases.},

abstract = {The paper describes parallelization strategies for the Discrete Element Method (DEM) used for simulating dense particulate systems coupled to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). While the field equations of CFD are best parallelized by spatial domain decomposition techniques, the N-body particulate phase is best parallelized over the number of particles. When the two are coupled together, both modes are needed for efficient parallelization. It is shown that under these requirements, OpenMP thread based parallelization has advantages over MPI processes. Two representative examples, fairly typical of dense fluid-particulate systems are investigated, including the validation of the DEM-CFD and thermal-DEM implementation with experiments. Fluidized bed calculations are performed on beds with uniform particle loading, parallelized with MPI and OpenMP. It is shown that as the number of processing cores and the number of particles increase, the communication overhead of building ghost particle lists at processor boundaries dominates time to solution, and OpenMP which does not require this step is about twice as fast as MPI. In rotary kiln heat transfer calculations, which are characterized by spatially non-uniform particle distributions, the low overhead of switching the parallelization mode in OpenMP eliminates the load imbalances, but introduces increased overheads in fetching non-local data. In spite of this, it is shown that OpenMP is between 50-90{\%} faster than MPI. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Experimental measurements of heat transfer to particles in fixed beds show either a constant value of the Nusselt group as the Reynolds number is reduced or, if axial dispersion has been neglected, the Nusselt group decreases to zero. A quantitative analysis of particle to fluid heat transfer on the basis of a stochastic model of the fixed bed leads to a constant value of the Nusselt group at low Reynolds number. When the analytical equation is included as an asymptotic condition, an expression is derived that describes the dependence of Nusselt group upon Reynolds number. The expression is extended to describe mass and heat transfer to fixed and fluidised beds of particles within the porosity range of 0.35–1.0. Both gas and liquid phase transfer groups are correlated up to a Reynolds number of 105. Des mesures exp{\'{e}}rimentales de transfert de chaleur {\`{a}} des particules dans des lits fixes montrent, lorsque le nombre de Reynolds est diminu{\'{e}}, soit une valeur constante du groupe de Nusselt, soit une d{\'{e}}croissance de celui-ci jusqu'{\`{a}} z{\'{e}}ro si la dispersion axiale est n{\'{e}}glig{\'{e}}e.

abstract = {Parabolic trough solar technology has been proven at nine commercial Solar Electric Generating Systems (SEGS) power plants that are operating in the California Mojave desert. These plants utilize steam Rankine cycle power plants, and as a result, most people associate parabolic trough solar technology with steam Rankine cycle power plant technology. Although these plants are clearly optimized for their particular application, other power cycle designs may be appropriate in other situations. Of particular interest is the integration of parabolic trough solar technology with combined cycle power plant technology. This configuration is referred to as integrated solar combined cycle systems (ISCCS). Four potential projects in India, Egypt, Morocco, and Mexico are considering the ISCCS type solar power cycle configurations. The key questions are when is the ISCCS configuration preferred over the SEGS power cycle configuration and how is the ISCCS plant designed to optimize the integration of the solar field and the power cycle. This paper reviews the results of a collaborative effort under the International Energy Agency SolarPACES organization to address these questions and it shows the potential environmental and economic benefits of each configuration.},

Volume, time and ensemble averaging procedures are discussed, and averaged equations and jump conditions are derived using a general averaging operator. A Reynolds decomposition and weighting procedure is applied to obtain the final equations. The equations necessary to close the system, so-called closure laws, are discussed. The mechanisms contributing to the viscosity of both phases and mixture viscosity models are presented. The particle pressure is discussed, and some simple models based on the modulus of elasticity concept are given. The interfacial momentum transfer term is discussed in detail, and a study of common models of the drag function is presented. A discussion of turbulence models for the gas and particulate phases is included. A summary and critical assessment of published work on simulations of hydrodynamics in bubbling and circulating fluidized beds are also presented.},

abstract = {One of the possible configurations of test blanket module (TBM) which will be tested during the ITER operation phase is made up of neutron multiplier and breeder as pebble beds. This paper describes an experimental device for the determination of the pebble bed conductivity in presence of interstitial air. The tests were performed with a simultaneous compression of the bed in order to obtain the effective bed conductivity versus the axial deformation for several values of the temperature. The effective conductivities of LiSiO4 and Li2TiO3 pebble beds, both in air and in vacuum, were determined. The packing factors of the beds were measured by means an ad hoc built instrumentation, based on the gamma ray backscattering. The experimental results have been compared with those of a theoretical model developed by the authors, obtaining a good agreement in terms of bed conductivity and stiffness. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Li4SiO4 is the reference breeder material for the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) Blanket concept. In the HCPB blanket lithium orthosilicate pebbles in the diameter range 0.25–0.63 mm are placed in a gap of about 10-mm width between two cooling plates. Therefore, in order to study the heat transfer in the blanket, the effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds has to be known. Measurements of the heat transfer parameters of a Li4SiO4 pebble bed have been performed at the Research Centre of Karlsruhe (Germany). In the experimental apparatus the pebble bed is contained in the annular space between two concentric stainless steel tubes. The internal tube is electrically heated and the heat flows through the bed in radial direction. Thermocouples in the tubes and in the pebble bed measure the temperature distribution in axial and in radial direction respectively, thus allowing the calculation of the heat transfer parameters of the bed. Measurements were performed with helium flowing through the bed at very low velocity, so that the heat transfer parameters were not affected by gas convection. In this paper the measured thermal conductivity data are presented and discussed. Experiments with different helium pressures show that, for pressures higher than 1 bar, there is no effect of the pressure variation on the thermal conductivity of the pebble bed (Smoluchowski effect).},

abstract = {Single-particle crushing tests have been carried out on the component minerals of a sand and the results have been compared statistically with those obtained for individually marked particles placed in triaxial samples and then subjected to isotropic consolidation and shear tests. The single-particle crushing strength was defined for breakage of asperities and for whole-particle fracture. The results were analysed and compared using particle survival probability curves. Maximum characteristic stresses were estimated for the individual particles embedded in the test specimens using a simplified analysis and then survival probabilities at these stress levels were abstracted from the curves for the single-particle tests. A statistical comparison with the observed particle breakages showed good agreement. A particle breakage factor was defined in terms of the evolution of the particle size grading curve with respect to the smallest particle size and related to the survival probability curve for the breakage of asperities. The degree of crushing as measured by the change in particle size distribution curves seems to be related to the size of the yield surface, with larger evolved yield surfaces causing more particle breakage.},

abstract = {The effective thermal conductivity of the pebble beds is one the most important design parameters for pebble bed solid breeder blanket. In the framework of IEA Implementing Agreement on Solid Breeder Subtask Group, measurement of pebble bed thermal conductivity by the hot wire method were defined as one of tasks to provide comparative information on the effective thermal conductivity of candidate ceramic pebble beds for DEMO blanket designs and ITER breeding blanket design. The authors previously reported the preliminary result of the pebble bed thermal conductivity for Li2O, Be and Al2O3. This paper presents the result of Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3 (1 mm diameter) from CEA, and Li4SiO4 (0.25 - 0.63 mm diameter) from FZK. Observation was compared to the correlations, SZB model and HM model. Contact area fraction was obtained by correlation fitting, of which the value is 4.9x10-3 for Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3 (the same value as Li2O) and 1x10-6 for and Li4SiO4.},

@book{Nellis2009,
abstract = {The single objective of this book is to provide engineers with the capability, tools, and confidence to solve real-world heat transfer problems. It includes many advanced topics, such as Bessel functions, Laplace transforms, separation of variables, Duhamel's theorem, and complex combination, as well as high order explicit and implicit numerical integration algorithms. These analytical and numerical solution methods are applied to topics not considered in most textbooks. Examples are heat exchangers involving fluids with varying specific heats or phase changes; heat exchangers in which axial conduction is a concern; and regenerators. To improve readability, derivations of important results are presented completely, without skipping steps, which reduces student frustration and improves retention. The examples in the book are ubiquitous, not trivial "textbook" exercises. They are rather complex and timely real-world problems that are inherently interesting. This textbook integrates the computational software packages Maple, MATLAB, FEHT, and Engineering Equation Solver (EES) directly with the heat transfer material.},

@article{dellorco:2006,
abstract = {The Helium Cooled PebbleBed (HCPB) Blanket is one of the reference concepts for the European Breeding Blanket Programme for DEMO. In the reference blanket module, alternate layers of lithiated ceramics and beryllium pebbles act, respectively, as tritium breeder and neutron multiplier. The thermo-mechanicalbehaviour of both the pebblebeds and their performances in reactor relevant conditions are also dependent on the pebble size and cell geometries (bed thickness, pebble packing factor, bed thermal conductivity). Therefore, in the EU Fusion Technology Programme, several out-of-pile experimental test campaigns have been performed to determine these behaviours. Theoretical calculations have been also launched for the prediction of the thermal and mechanical performances of the pebblebeds under different testing conditions. More recently, among the EU Associations involved in the ceramic breeder qualification, a benchmarkexercise has been launched to select the pebblebed thermal mechanical constitutive models to be implemented in a FEM computer code. This paper describes the activities, carried out by ENEA and DIN, University of Palermo (I), for the first comparison with the results of the experiments carried out at HE-FUS 3 facility of ENEA Brasimone on the HELICA mock-up. The paper describes the test conditions and also presents the main experimental results and its first comparison with the theoretical calculations.},

abstract = {The effect of boundaries on the force distributions in granular media is illustrated by simulations of 2D packings of frictionless, Hertzian spheres. To elucidate discrepancies between experimental observations and theoretical predictions, we distinguish between the weight distribution {\{}$\backslash$cal P{\}} (w) measured in experiments and analyzed in the q-model, and the distribution of interparticle forces P(f). The latter one is robust, while {\{}$\backslash$cal P{\}}(w) can be obtained once the local packing geometry and P(f) are known. By manipulating the (boundary) geometry, we show that {\{}$\backslash$cal P{\}}(w) can be varied drastically.},

Implanted, apatite-coated, PLGA scaffolds seeded with ADAS or BMS cells produced significant intramembranous bone formation by 2 weeks and areas of complete bony bridging by 12 weeks as shown by X-ray analysis, histology and live micromolecular imaging. The contribution of implanted cells to new bone formation was 84-99{\%} by chromosomal detection.

abstract = {The concept of using stem cells as self-renewing sources of healthy cells in regenerative medicine has existed for decades, but most applications have yet to achieve clinical success. A main reason for the lack of successful stem cell therapies is the difficulty in fully recreating the maintenance and control of the native stem cell niche. Improving the performance of transplanted stem cells therefore requires a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms guiding stem cell behavior in both native and engineered three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. Most techniques, however, for uncovering mechanisms controlling cell behavior in vitro have been developed using 2D cell cultures and are of limited use in 3D environments such as engineered tissue constructs. Deciphering the mechanisms controlling stem cell fate in native and engineered 3D environments, therefore, requires rigorous quantitative techniques that permit mechanistic, hypothesis-driven studies of cell-microenvironment interactions. Here, we review the current understanding of 2D and 3D stem cell control mechanisms and propose an approach to uncovering the mechanisms that govern stem cell behavior in 3D.},

Using a micropatterning approach to control the initial three-dimensional structure of mouse mammary epithelial tubules in culture, combined with an algorithm to quantify the extent of branching, we found that the geometry of tubules dictates the position of branches. We predicted numerically and confirm experimentally that branches initiate at sites with a local minimum in the concentration of autocrine inhibitory morphogens, such as transforming growth factor-beta. These results reveal that tissue geometry can control organ morphogenesis by defining the local cellular microenvironment, a finding that has relevance to control of invasion and metastasis.},

abstract = {Macroporous scaffolds composed of biodegradable polymers have found extensive use as three-dimensional substrates either for in vitro cell seeding followed by transplantation, or as conductive substrates for direct implantation in vivo. Methods abound for creation of macroporous scaffolds for tissue engineering, and common methods typically employ a solid porogen within a three-dimensional polymer matrix to create a well-defined pore size, pore structure, and total scaffold porosity. This study describes an approach to impart improved pore interconnectivity to polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering by partially fusing the solid porogen together prior to creation of a continuous polymer matrix. Three dimensional, porous scaffolds of the copolymer 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were fabricated via either a solvent casting/particulate leaching process, or a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Prior to creation of a continuous polymer matrix the NaCl crystals, which serve as the solid porogen, are partially fused via treatment in 95{\%} humidity. Scanning electron micrographs clearly display fused salt crystals and an enhancement in pore interconnectivity in the salt fused scaffolds prepared via both solvent casting and gas foaming, and the extent of pore interconnectivity is enhanced with longer treatment times. Fusion of salt crystal for 24 h increased the radius of curvature of salt crystals, and led to a twofold increase in the compressive modulus of solvent cast scaffolds (total porosity of 97 +/- 1{\%}). Fusion of NaCl crystals prior to gas foaming resulted in a decrease in scaffold compressive modulus from 277 +/- 60k Pa to 187 +/- 30k Pa (total porosity of 94 +/- 1{\%}). The resulting highly interconnected scaffolds have implications for facilitated cell migration, abundant cell-cell interaction, and potentially improved neural and vascular growth within tissue engineering scaffolds.},

@article{Muschler2004a,
abstract = {Tissue engineering is a rapidly evolving discipline that seeks to repair, replace, or regenerate specific tissues or organs by translating fundamental knowledge in physics, chemistry, and biology into practical and effective materials, devices, systems, and clinical strategies. Stem cells and progenitors that are capable of forming new tissue with one or more connective tissue phenotypes are available from many adult tissues and are defined as connective tissue progenitors. There are four major cell-based tissue-engineering strategies: (1) targeting local connective tissue progenitors where new tissue is desired, (2) transplanting autogenous connective tissue progenitors, (3) transplanting culture-expanded or modified connective tissue progenitors, and (4) transplanting fully formed tissue generated in vitro or in vivo. Stem cell function is controlled by changes in stem cell activation and self-renewal or by changes in the proliferation, migration, differentiation, or survival of the progeny of stem cell activation, the downstream progenitor cells. Three-dimensional porous scaffolds promote new tissue formation by providing a surface and void volume that promotes the attachment, migration, proliferation, and desired differentiation of connective tissue progenitors throughout the region where new tissue is needed. Critical variables in scaffold design and function include the bulk material or materials from which it is made, the three-dimensional architecture, the surface chemistry, the mechanical properties, the initial environment in the area of the scaffold, and the late scaffold environment, which is often determined by degradation characteristics. Local presentation or delivery of bioactive molecules can change the function of connective tissue progenitors (activation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, or survival) in a manner that results in new or enhanced local tissue formation. All cells require access to substrate molecules (oxygen, glucose, and amino acids). A balance between consumption and local delivery of these substrates is needed if cells are to survive. Transplanted cells are particularly vulnerable. Theoretical calculations can be used to explore the relationships among cell density, diffusion distance, and cell viability within a graft and to design improved strategies for transplantation of connective tissue progenitors. Rational strategies for tissue engineering seek to optimize new tissue formation through the logical selection of conditions that modulate the performance of connective tissue progenitors in a graft site to produce a desired tissue. This increasingly involves strategies that combine cells, matrices, inductive stimuli, and techniques that enhance the survival and performance of local or transplanted connective tissue progenitors.},

abstract = {The development of tissues and organs is typically driven by the action of a number of growth factors. However, efforts to regenerate tissues (e.g., bone, blood vessels) typically rely on the delivery of single factors, and this may partially explain the limited clinical utility of many current approaches. One constraint on delivering appropriate combinations of factors is a lack of delivery vehicles that allow for a localized and controlled delivery of more than a single factor. We report a new polymeric system that allows for the tissue-specific delivery of two or more growth factors, with controlled dose and rate of delivery. The utility of this system was investigated in the context of therapeutic angiogenesis. We now demonstrate that dual delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, each with distinct kinetics, from a single, structural polymer scaffold results in the rapid formation of a mature vascular network. This is the first report of a vehicle capable of delivery of multiple angiogenic factors with distinct kinetics, and these results clearly indicate the importance of multiple growth factor action in tissue regeneration and engineering.},

abstract = {A family of injectable, rapid gelling and highly flexible hydrogel composites capable of releasing insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and delivering mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) were developed. Hydrogel composites were fabricated from Type I collagen, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and a thermosensitive and degradable hydrogel copolymer based on N-isopropylacrylamide, acrylic acid, N-acryloxysuccinimide and a macromer poly(trimethylene carbonate)-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The hydrogel copolymer was gellable at body temperature before degradation and soluble at body temperature after degradation. Hydrogel composites exhibited LCSTs around room temperature. They could easily be injected through a 26-gauge needle at 4 degrees C, and were capable of gelling within 6s at 37 degrees C to form highly flexible gels with moduli matching those of the rat and human myocardium. The hydrogel composites showed good oxygen permeability; the oxygen pressure within the hydrogel composites was similar to that in the air. The effects of collagen and CS contents on LCST, gelation time, injectability, mechanical properties and degradation properties were investigated. IGF-1 was loaded into the hydrogel composites for enhanced cell survival/growth. The released IGF-1 remained bioactive during a 2-week release period. Small fraction of CS in the hydrogel composites significantly decreased IGF-1 release rate. The release kinetics appeared to be controlled mainly by hydrogel composite water content, degradation and interaction with IGF-1. Human MSC adhesion on the hydrogel composites was comparable to that on the tissue culture plate. MSCs were encapsulated in the hydrogel composites and were found to grow inside during a 7-day culture period. IGF-1 loading significantly accelerated MSC growth. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MSCs maintained their multipotent differentiation potential in hydrogel composites with and without IGF-1. These injectable and rapid gelling hydrogel composites demonstrated attractive properties for serving as growth factor and cell carriers for cardiovascular tissue engineering applications.},

Although the cloned cells would carry the nuclear genome of the patient, the presence of mitochondria inherited from the recipient oocyte raises questions about the histocompatibility of the resulting cells. In this study, we created bioengineered tissues from cardiac, skeletal muscle, and renal cells cloned from adult bovine fibroblasts. Long-term viability was demonstrated after transplantation of the grafts into the nuclear donor animals. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis confirmed that the cloned tissues expressed tissue-specific mRNA and proteins while expressing a different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype. In addition to creating skeletal muscle and cardiac "patches", nuclear transplantation was used to generate functioning renal units that produced urinelike fluid and demonstrated unidirectional secretion and concentration of urea nitrogen and creatinine. Examination of the explanted renal devices revealed formation of organized glomeruli- and tubule-like structures. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing in vivo and Elispot analysis in vitro suggested that there was no rejection response to the cloned renal cells. The ability to generate histocompatible cells using cloning techniques addresses one of the major challenges in transplantation medicine.},

abstract = {ES (embryonic stem) cell differentiation is dependent on the presence of HS (heparan sulfate). We have demonstrated that, during differentiation, the evolution of specific cell lineages is associated with particular patterns of GAG (glycosaminoglycan) expression. For example, different HS epitopes are synthesized during neural or mesodermal lineage formation. Cell lines mutant for various components of the HS biosynthetic pathway are selectively impaired in their differentiation, with lineage-specific effects observed for some lines. We have also observed that the addition of soluble GAG saccharides to cells, with or without cell-surface HS, can influence the pace and outcome of differentiation, again highlighting specific pattern requirements for particular lineages. We are combining this work with ongoing studies into the design of artificial cell environments where we have optimized three-dimensional scaffolds, generated by electrospinning or by the formation of hydrogels, for the culture of ES cells. By permeating these scaffolds with defined GAG oligosaccharides, we intend to control the mechanical environment of the cells (via the scaffold architecture) as well as their biological signalling environment (using the oligosaccharides). We predict that this will allow us to control ES cell pluripotency and differentiation in a three-dimensional setting, allowing the generation of differentiated cell types for use in drug discovery/testing or in therapeutics.},

abstract = {Polymeric vesicles are a relatively new class of nanoscale self-assembled materials that show great promise as robust encapsulants. Compared with liposomes, use of polymeric building blocks for membrane formation allows increased stability, stimuli responsiveness and chemical diversity, which may prove advantageous for drug-delivery applications . A major drawback of most polymeric vesicles is the lack of biofunctionality, which restricts their ability to interact with cells and tissues. We have prepared vesicles composed of polyarginine and polyleucine segments that are stable in media, can entrap water soluble species, and can be processed to different sizes and prepared in large quantities. The remarkable feature of these materials is that the polyarginine segments both direct structure for vesicle formation and provide functionality for efficient intracellular delivery of the vesicles. This unique synergy between nanoscale self-assembly and inherent peptide functionality provides a new approach for design of multifunctional materials for drug delivery.},

abstract = {Within the framework of the ITER Test Blanket Working Group, the ITER Parties have made several proposals for test blanket modules to be tested in ITER from the first day of H–H operation. This paper gives an overview of the proposed TBMs designs, of the ITER boundary conditions and of the expected TBM operating conditions. Operating conditions will vary throughout the various ITER phases, starting from the initial H–H phase where no neutrons and, therefore, no nuclear volume heating will be present, to the later D–T phase where pulses of up to 3000 s length may be expected. The paper is focused on the design requirements for the materials and subcomponents that will be used in the various TBMs, from the viewpoint of both the materials performance and the required R{\&}D.},

@article{Abou-Sena2007,
abstract = {Tritium breeding materials, which have the ability to react with neutrons and produce tritium, are required to fuel fusion reactions. Tritium is produced inside the fusion blanket by neutron irradiation of lithium ceramics (tritium breeders). Using the lithium ceramics in form of pebbles-packed bed is a promising concept for fusion blankets, and worldwide efforts have been dedicated to its R{\&}D. Thermal properties of lithium ceramic pebble beds have a significant impact upon the thermal performance of the fusion blanket. Specifically, the effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds is important for the design and analysis of fusion blankets. The experimental apparatus of this study was designed and built based on the principles of the steady state and axial heat flow methods in order to conduct the required measurements. The objective of this study is to measure the effective thermal conductivity of a Li2TiO3 pebble bed as a function of the average bed temperature. The pebble bed has pebbles of 1.7–2.0 mm diameter and a packing fraction of 61{\%}. Helium at atmospheric pressure was used as a filling gas. The experimental results showed that the effective thermal conductivity decreased from 1.40 to 0.94 W/m K with the increase of the average bed temperature from 50 to 500 °C. The results presented in this work will help to create a database of the effective thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pebble beds which can be used for the design and analysis of fusion blankets.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior and properties of particle beds relevant to fusion ceramic breeder blanket designs are addressed through a combination of experimental and analytical studies. A series of uniaxial compression tests are performed in a INSTRON hydraulic-press test facility in which compressive loads are applied to Li2ZrO3 and aluminum packed beds. The experimental data shows that the mechanical properties such as the bed effective modulus are stress dependent and consistent with the analytical model predictions. Nevertheless, the experimental data shows that the bed effective modulus is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solid material.},
