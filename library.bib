@article{Saito:1998oq,
abstract = {Lithium ceramics have been considered as tritium breeders for fusion reactors. As a part of the study program for fusion blanket development, the characteristics of tritium breeders are estimated for the material selection and fusion blanket design. Among the candidate tritium breeders, lithium titanate ( Li 2 TiO 3 ) is regarded as one of the best materials because of many advantages, reasonable lithium atom density, low activation, excellent tritium release characteristic at low temperature, compatibility with structural materials, reprocessing, etc. However, only limited data on the thermal and mechanical characteristics of Li 2 TiO 3 have been obtained for breeder material selection and fusion blanket design. In this study, Li 2 TiO 3 pellets with three different densities, i.e., 73\%T.D., 83\%T.D. and 93\%T.D., were prepared. Then, the density dependence and the thermal hysteresis of their thermal conductivity, specific heat and thermal expansion were investigated.},

abstract = {An analytical solution to the transient thermal behavior of a rock-bed thermal storage system subjected to varying air inlet temperature is presented. The solution is obtained in terms of infinite double series which are based on Schumann's solution, derived for a step change in air inlet temperature. In the present study, bed and fluid temperatures in response to arbitrary fluid inlet temperatures are calculated by means of Duhamel's theorem. Results of this study were verified experimentally and compared to a numerical solution. Agreement in both these cases was very good. Pressure drop data were compared to values predicted by two previously published correlations. These correlations were found to underpredict the measured data by factors in the range 1.5-5. Reasons for this discrepancy are mainly due to the differences in the type and particularly the shapes of rocks used in the different studies.},

@article{Reimann:2002kl,
abstract = {The thermomechanical interaction of solid breeder and beryllium pebble beds with structural material (BSMI) has been identified as a critical issue for solid breeder blanket designs. For example, the expansion of pebble beds restrained by blanket structure exerts stresses on the pebbles as well as the blanket structure wall, which might cause the pebbles to break and jeopardise the blanket operation. However, at elevated temperatures thermal creep will reduce these stresses and might compensate for stress build-up due to irradiation-induced swelling. A significant influence of irradiation on the pebble bed properties is expected. Computationally, the BSMI can be assessed in two ways: (i) by applying appropriate finite element codes combined with the description of modules for the pebble beds. As input, these modules require data on characteristic pebble bed properties determined in different standard-type tests; (ii) by numerical simulations based on a discrete numerical model. Here, the stress profiles are calculated while the effective modulus and bed thermal expansion coefficients are back estimated. In this paper, recent experimental results on thermomechanical pebble bed properties for ceramic breeder (metatitanate and orthosilicate) pebble beds and beryllium pebble beds are presented, including data on the moduli of deformation, thermal creep, inner friction angle, and thermal conductivity of deformed pebble beds. Furthermore, modelling results of the BSMI for simple geometries are reported based both on homogeneous and discrete models and are compared with experimental results.},

abstract = {In Europe, two breeding blankets are currently developed for DEMO reactor specifications, corresponding to two different research lines, one using a liquid breeder, the Helium-Cooled Lithium-Lead (HCLL) blanket, and one using lithiated solid breeder, the Helium-Cooled Pebble-Bed (HCPB) blanket. Referring to the so called "fast-track" EU strategy, those concepts are intended to be tested in ITER, getting the maximum of information required for launching the DEMO blanket design and construction after the first 10 years of ITER operation. For that, the EU has adopted a blanket testing strategy based on the development of Test Blanket Modules (TBM) that are expected to use DEMO relevant technologies and are designed for each ITER plasma phase to optimize the added value of results and to avoid any impact on ITER availability. Prior to their insertion in ITER, EU is running a significant R\&D program for the development and qualification of HCLL and HCPB Test Blanket Modules, including at a later stage functional tests of integrated TBM mock-ups. ?? 2005 The European Commission.

An extensive development program has been carried-out over the last decade combining experimental and numerical simulations aimed at identifying and quantifying physical phenomena occurring in breeder blankets and at optimizing their design and technologies accordingly. On this basis, sound guidelines for the design and technological choices of Test Blanket Modules can be derived. In addition, regulatory and ITER project requirements, which prefigure the future DEMO blanket ones, are now integrated in the development and qualification program of the Test Blanket Modules. Their scope and implication are analyzed.},

abstract = {If a liquid, initially at uniform temperature, passes lengthwise through a right, porous prism, initially at some other uniform temperature, the sides of the prism being adiabatic and impervious to the liquid, then the temperatures of both liquid and solid will be functions of the time and of a distance. The problem of finding the temperature distributions has been solved assuming the well-known laws governing the transfer of heat from a liquid in turbulent motion to a solid. The solution as presented involves the use of some interesting mathematical functions which are related to the well-known Bessel Functions. If a gas is used instead of a liquid, the problem is much more complicated, but a dimensional method of treating the problem leads to results which may be very useful in practice. The author wishes to express his thanks and appreciation to Dr. S. Y. Burke for suggesting this research and showing such a stimulating interest during its development, and also to the Combustion Utilities Corporation for permission to publish the results.},

The experiments study the thermo-mechanical performance of lithium meta-titanate oxide (Li2TiO3) pebbles and silicon carbide clad constrained by a low thermal expansion alloy in vacuum and He atmosphere. The results show that large deformations due to induced thermal stresses are present during the first heat cycle but afterward are accommodated by a combination of pebble re-arrangement within the bed and thermally induced creep deformation. Initial results of a numerical simulation of the experiments using a finite element code that includes creep deformation is also presented. Planned operation of the UCLA thermo-mechanics test facility is summarized to conclude the paper.},

abstract = {In the frame of the activities of the EU Breeder Blanket Programme and of the Test Blanket Working Group of ITER, the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB TBM) is developed in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) to investigate DEMO relevant concepts for blanket modules. The three main functions of a blanket module (removing heat, breeding tritium and shielding sensitive components from radiation) will be tested in ITER using a series of four TBMs, which are irradiated successively during different test campaigns. Each HCPB TBM will be installed, with a vertical orientation, into the vacuum vessel connected to one equatorial port. As the studies performed up to 2006 in FZK concerned a horizontal orientation of the HCPB TBM, a global review of the design is necessary to match with the new ITER specifications. A preliminary version of the new vertical design is proposed extrapolating the neutronic analysis performed for the horizontal HCPB TBM. An overview of the new HCPB TBM vertical designs, as well as the preliminary thermal and fluid dynamic analyses performed for the validation of the design, are presented in this paper. A critical review of the results obtained allows us, in the conclusion, to prepare a plan for the future detailed analyses of the vertical HCPB TBM. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper examines the value of concentrating solar power (CSP) and thermal energy storage (TES) in four regions in the southwestern United States. Our analysis shows that TES can increase the value of CSP by allowing more thermal energy from a CSP plant’s solar field to be used, by allowing a CSP plant to accommodate a larger solar field, and by allowing CSP generation to be shifted to hours with higher energy prices. We analyze the sensitivity of CSP value to a number of factors, including the optimization period, price and solar forecasting, ancillary service sales, capacity value and dry cooling of the CSP plant. We also discuss the value of CSP plants and TES net of capital costs.},

An extensive development program has been carried-out over the last decade combining experimental and numerical simulations aimed at identifying and quantifying physical phenomena occurring in breeder blankets and at optimizing their design and technologies accordingly. On this basis, sound guidelines for the design and technological choices of Test Blanket Modules can be derived. In addition, regulatory and ITER project requirements, which prefigure the future DEMO blanket ones, are now integrated in the development and qualification program of the Test Blanket Modules. Their scope and implication are analyzed.},

The results obtained by several versions of a lattice Boltzmann based code were compared with the results of PIV and LDA measurements and with those of a commercial finite volume solver. The best version from the tested lattice Boltzmann codes was chosen for further comparisons and grid convergence measurement. It was shown that the lattice Boltzmann method is capable of producing results with an accuracy comparable to the finite volume solver in a 3D unsteady flow and also that the results are in good agreement with the experimental results. It was also shown that using a GPU implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method it is possible to significantly reduce the run-time length compared to the CPU only implementation of the lattice Boltzmann method.},

The six parameters are the temperature distribution along the height of the storage tank at different time intervals, the charging energy efficiency, the charging exergy efficiency, the stratification number, the Reynolds number and the Richardson number. These parameters are evaluated under six different experimental charging conditions. Temperature distribution along the height of the storage tank at different time intervals and the stratification number are parameters found to describe thermal stratification quantitatively adequately. On the other-hand, the charging exergy efficiency and the Reynolds number give important information about describing thermal stratification qualitatively and should be used with care. The charging energy efficiency and the Richardson number have no clear relationship with thermal stratification.},

@article{Li2011,
abstract = {This paper examined the features of three typical thermal storage systems including: 1) direct storage of heat transfer fluid in containers, 2) storage of thermal energy in a packed bed of solid filler material, with energy being carried in/out by a flowing heat transfer fluid which directly contacts the packed bed, and 3) a system in which heat transfer fluid flows through tubes that are imbedded into a thermal storage material which may be solid, liquid, or a mixture of the two. The similarity of the three types of thermal storage systems was discussed, and generalized energy storage governing equations were introduced in both dimensional and dimensionless forms. The temperatures of the heat transfer fluid during energy charge and discharge processes and the overall energy storage efficiencies were studied through solution of the energy storage governing equations. Finally, provided in the paper are a series of generalized charts bearing curves for energy storage effectiveness against four dimensionless parameters grouped up from many of the thermal storage system properties including dimensions, fluid and thermal storage material properties, as well as the operational conditions including mass flow rate of the fluid, and the ratio of energy charge and discharge time periods. Engineers can conveniently look up the charts to design and calibrate the size of thermal storage tanks and operational conditions without doing complicated individual modeling and computations. It is expected that the charts will serve as standard tools for thermal storage system design and calibration.},

Results of investigations show that materials do meet the B.I.T. requirements. Moreover, the excellent tritium release performance of Li2ZrO 3 and Li2TiO 3 designate these ceramics as promising materials for the ITER breeding blanket.},

abstract = {Interparticle forces in granular media form an inhomogeneous distribution of filamentary force chains. Understanding such forces and their spatial correlations, specifically in response to forces at the system boundaries, represents a fundamental goal of granular mechanics. The problem is of relevance to civil engineering, geophysics and physics, being important for the understanding of jamming, shear-induced yielding and mechanical response. Here we report measurements of the normal and tangential grain-scale forces inside a two-dimensional system of photoelastic disks that are subject to pure shear and isotropic compression. Various statistical measures show the underlying differences between these two stress states. These differences appear in the distributions of normal forces (which are more rounded for compression than shear), although not in the distributions of tangential forces (which are exponential in both cases). Sheared systems show anisotropy in the distributions of both the contact network and the contact forces. Anisotropy also occurs in the spatial correlations of forces, which provide a quantitative replacement for the idea of force chains. Sheared systems have long-range correlations in the direction of force chains, whereas isotropically compressed systems have short-range correlations regardless of the direction.},

Corresponding experiments with a smaller parameter variation were carried out with Li2TiO3, Li2ZrO3, and Li2O pebble beds. Empirical correlations for the moduli of deformation are presented for the different materials and first relationships for thermal creep of Li4SiO4 pebble beds are given. Using a different test facility, uniaxial tests were carried out with monosized and binary beryllium pebble beds in a temperature range between ambient and 480°C and pressures up to 8 MPa. Again, relationships for the deformation modulus are presented.},

It has two fitting parameters, the width and average radius of the narrow gaps that exist between the irregularly shaped particles and which contribute significantly to the thermal conductivity. Since both parameters are physically measurable, the model holds the potential for calculating the thermal conductivity without any adjustable parameters. Agreement is excellent with measurements on alumina particles in helium at 100–500°C up to 100 kPa pressure.},

This paper presents recent achievements of research activities for the TBM, particularly addressing the pebble bed of the tritium breeder materials and tritium behaviour. For the breeder material, the chemical stability of Li 2 TiO 3 was improved using Li 2 O additives. To analyse the pebble bed behaviour, thermomechanical properties of the Li 2 TiO 3 pebble bed were assessed experimentally. To verify the pebble bed's nuclear properties, the activation foil method was proposed and a preliminary experiment was conducted. To reduce the tritium permeation, the chemical densified coating method was developed and the coating was attached to F82H steel. For tritium behaviour, the tritium recovery system was modified in consideration of the design change of the TBM.},

It is hoped that prior converts to the use of DEM will also benefit from a relatively objective overview of current DEM use in geomechanics. The introductory sections present the background to the method and give an overview of the evolution of the use of particulate DEM in recent geotechnical research. The general principals of the algorithm are then presented, considering the types of particles typically used, the calculation of contact forces, and formulation of simulation boundary conditions.

abstract = {Tritium breeding materials, which have the ability to react with neutrons and produce tritium, are required to fuel fusion reactions. Tritium is produced inside the fusion blanket by neutron irradiation of lithium ceramics (tritium breeders). Using the lithium ceramics in form of pebbles-packed bed is a promising concept for fusion blankets, and worldwide efforts have been dedicated to its R\&D. Thermal properties of lithium ceramic pebble beds have a significant impact upon the thermal performance of the fusion blanket. Specifically, the effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds is important for the design and analysis of fusion blankets. The experimental apparatus of this study was designed and built based on the principles of the steady state and axial heat flow methods in order to conduct the required measurements. The objective of this study is to measure the effective thermal conductivity of a Li2TiO3 pebble bed as a function of the average bed temperature. The pebble bed has pebbles of 1.7–2.0 mm diameter and a packing fraction of 61\%. Helium at atmospheric pressure was used as a filling gas. The experimental results showed that the effective thermal conductivity decreased from 1.40 to 0.94 W/m K with the increase of the average bed temperature from 50 to 500 °C. The results presented in this work will help to create a database of the effective thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pebble beds which can be used for the design and analysis of fusion blankets.},

@article{Herrmann2004883,
abstract = {The most advanced thermal energy storage for solar thermal power plants is a two-tank storage system where the heat transfer fluid (HTF) also serves as storage medium. This concept was successfully demonstrated in a commercial trough plant (13.8 MWe SEGS I plant; 120 MWht storage capacity) and a demonstration tower plant (10 MWe Solar Two; 105 MWht storage capacity). However, the HTF used in state-of-the-art parabolic trough power plants (30-80 MWe) is expensive, dramatically increasing the cost of larger HTF storage systems. An engineering study was carried out to evaluate a concept, where another (less expensive) liquid medium such as molten salt is utilized as storage medium rather than the HTF itself. Detailed performance and cost analyses were conducted to evaluate the economic value of this concept. The analyses are mainly based on the operation experience from the SEGS plants and the Solar Two project. The study concluded that the specific cost for a two-tank molten salt storage is in the range of US\$ 30-40/kWhth depending on storage size. Since the salt storage was operated successfully in the Solar Two project, no major barriers were identified to realize this concept in the first commercial parabolic trough power plant.},

abstract = {In HCPB blankets, interfaces between pebble beds and structural material provide for an additional heat resistance, which depends on local mechanical stresses and temperature. The heat transfer coefficient of pebble bed–wall interfaces was investigated by modelling particle–wall contact, radiation effect, and interstitial gas. The predictions of the model were compared to the experimental data. Interfacial modelling as presented by this paper, which takes the coupled thermo-mechanical behaviour of the interface into account, opens up the possibility to implement these effects in a finite element simulation of a structure containing pebble beds.},

abstract = {3D computer simulations and experiments are employed to study random packings of compressible spherical grains under external confining stress. In the rigid ball limit, we find a continuous transition in which the stress vanishes as (straight phi-straight phi(c))(beta), where straight phi is the (solid phase) volume density. The value of straight phi(c) depends on whether the grains interact via only normal forces (giving rise to random close packings) or by a combination of normal and friction generated transverse forces (producing random loose packings). In both cases, near the transition, the system's response is controlled by localized force chains.},

abstract = {Lithium metatitanate (Li2TiO3) is a candidate tritium breeding material for fusion reactor blankets. In an actual blanket the pebbles are geometrically confined in a containing structure subjected to displacement and stress constraints under operating conditions. For an accurate description of pebble behavior during operations, existing data of pebble deformation under compressive loads is inadequate. In this study a uniaxial compression experimental apparatus was built to investigate time dependent creep on a single pebble as a function of applied force and temperature relevant to blanket conditions. Experimental results shows that at a temperature range of 700-800 °C, the crush load of Li2Ti03 pebbles is reduced by about half of its room temperature crush load. The experimental results allow for the establishment of a pebble creep failure map as a function of force and temperature, which provides guidance to the blanket designs. The study also introduces an FEA model based on experimental deformation data to obtain the constitutive equation needed for Discrete Element Model simulation of the pebble bed.},

abstract = {Results from thermal creep experiments on beryllium pebble beds consisting of 1 mm NGK pebbles are presented. The experiments were performed in the uniaxial test facility HECOP II at temperatures ranging between 450 °C and 650 °C and under uniaxial stresses up to 3.6 MPa. A correlation of the typewas established. Compared to ceramic breeder materials, beryllium pebble beds are characterised by larger creep strains (by a factor 5–10) for given creep parameter values. For blanket conditions, these differences are smaller because characteristic temperatures are lower for beryllium than for the breeder material. For relatively short creep time periods, this factor is about 2–3. With these results, a complete set of data exists, required as input for codes used for the description of the thermal–mechanical interaction of solid breeder and beryllium pebble beds with the structural material of blanket elements.},

abstract = {An analysis, with experimental results, for the transient response of a packed bed thermal storage unit is presented. The analysis is in two spatial dimensions and considers the influence of both axial and radial thermal dispersion for arbitrary time and radial variations in the inlet fluid temperature. Both charging and recovery modes are included. Spatial variations in void fraction are found to have significant influence on the dynamic response of both fluid and solid temperatures. An unconditionally stable numerical model is developed that predicts the two-dimensional transient response of both solid and fluid phases. The influence of radial velocity variations, wall heat capacity and wall thermal losses are considered. The analysis is valid for fluids of various Prandtl numbers. Experimental measurements of temperature distributions in a randomly packed bed of uniform spheres, with air as the working fluid, compare favorably with the analytical results over a broad range of Reynolds numbers. Results are presented for full-size rock beds which indicate pronounced effects of void distribution in such systems.},

abstract = {Results from thermal creep experiments on beryllium pebble beds consisting of 1mm NGK pebbles are presented. The experiments were performed in the uniaxial test facility HECOP II at temperatures ranging between 450°C and 650°C and under uniaxial stresses up to 3.6MPa. A correlation of the type$\epsilon$cr=A exp−BT$\sigma$ptnwas established. Compared to ceramic breeder materials, beryllium pebble beds are characterised by larger creep strains (by a factor 5–10) for given creep parameter values. For blanket conditions, these differences are smaller because characteristic temperatures are lower for beryllium than for the breeder material. For relatively short creep time periods, this factor is about 2–3. With these results, a complete set of data exists, required as input for codes used for the description of the thermal–mechanical interaction of solid breeder and beryllium pebble beds with the structural material of blanket elements.},

abstract = {Beryllium will be used as a neutron multiplier in Helium Cooled PebbleBed (HCPB) DEMO blankets. The beryllium thermal conductivity is determining the maximum pebblebed temperature and, therefore, is very important for blanket design. Different grades of beryllium discs were neutron-irradiated at temperatures between 343 and 673 K and at fluences up to 1.6 × 1023 cm−2. At lower irradiation temperatures a significant drop of the beryllium thermal conductivity occurs even after small neutron fluences. With increasing neutron fluence, further moderate decreases of the conductivity are observed. With increasing irradiation temperature, the thermal conductivity further decreases. If the thermal conductivity of the irradiated beryllium is known, the conductivity of irradiated beryllium pebblebeds can be assessed using the model suggested in this study.},

abstract = {It is known that the test of the capability of tritium self-sufficiency and the extraction of high-grade heat using tritium breeding blanket concepts is one of the major ITER missions. This requires the development of test blanket modules based on a corresponding DEMO blanket design, despite the differences in operating conditions between DEMO and ITER. Two blanket concepts such as a Helium-Cooled Solid Breeder (HCSB) blanket and a Helium-Cooled Molten Lithium (HCML) blanket are being considered as Korean Test Blanket Module (TBM) for ITER with the aim for verifying the capability of the breeding blanket design and manufacturability. In this paper, the current status of the design and analysis for the HCSB TBM is described. The key features of the design include the use of graphite neutron reflectors to reduce the amount of beryllium multiplier. Major analyses have been executed in order to optimize the design. The results of nuclear and thermo-hydraulic analysis show that the design parameters and requirements are satisfied. Also, the safety analysis results show that the design of the TBM system is sufficient to endure several accident events. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In particular, the DIN developed a thermo-mechanical constitutive model for these pebble beds to be validated against the HEXCALIBER mock-up test campaign, carried out at the ENEA HE-FUS3 facility. The paper presents the main results of the mock-up experimental tests and of their numerical simulations performed adopting the finite element method, which allowed the DIN constitutive model to be assessed and validated.},

@article{Shipway1997,
abstract = {Results are presented of a theoretical and experimental study of the fracture of single brittle spheres by uniaxial compression between opposed platens and by free impact against plane targets. The stress distributions in elastic spheres are broadly similar under both types of loading, with significant tensile components inside the sphere on the axis of the system and on the surface of the sphere, around the equator for the case of compression. The magnitudes and locations of the peak values of these stresses depend on the size of the contact area (relative to the size of the sphere), which in turn depends on the mechanical properties of the target and platen material. A simple equation used by previous investigators to estimate the maximum internal tensile from the load provides a useful approximation only under certain conditions, and more generally leads to significant error. Experiments with lead glass spheres have shown that under many conditions of compression and impact testing, failure initiates on the surface, rather than internally, at a critical value of tensile stress. The work is relevant to the breakage attrition of brittle particles in powder transport, handling and processing, and also to comminution. It also provides a basis for the interpretation of indirect tensile tests in which spherical samples are uniaxially compressed.},

The Tanaka integral not only provides a simple integral to numerically compute the exact value of the view factor between two unit spheres without a blockage, but also plays a fundamental role in improving the computed shaded view factor between two spheres subject to any blockage. The product Fibonacci integration scheme, essentially a ray-tracing method, appears to be a low cost but sufficiently accurate cubature for evaluating the dual-integral defining the view factor. The use of a particular non-uniform scaling function very favourably modulates the properties of the view factor integrals, and thus substantially improves the solution accuracy of the Fibonacci integration scheme. Several practical issues associated with the accuracy and efficiency of the procedure are discussed, and test cases are provided to illustrate the applicability of the procedure.},

abstract = {In this paper, a discrete element simulation scheme for pebble beds in fusion blankets is presented. Each individual pebble is considered as one element obeying equilibrium conditions under contact forces. We study not only the rearrangement of particles but also the overall behaviour of an assembly under the action of macroscopic compressive stresses. Using random close packing as initial configurations, the discrete element simulation of the uniaxial compression test has been quantitatively compared to experiments. This method yields the distribution of the inter-particle contact forces. Moreover, the micro-macro relations have been investigated to relate the microscopic information, such as the maximum contact force and the coordination number inside the assembly, to the macroscopic stress variables.},

The related neutronics calculations were performed with the Monte Carlo code MCNP5 using the latest MCNP geometry model of ITER, named "A-lite". The TBM model was generated with the geometry conversion tool McCad on the basis of a dedicated CAD model and integrated into one half of the equatorial test blanket port of the A-lite model. The neutronic calculations provided assessments of the total tritium and heat production in the TBM and its components as well as evaluations for the detailed spatial distributions of the neutron flux and the power density. Fine mesh tally calculations were utilized to provide high fidelity results for the distributions that enable identification of crucial issues. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A pressure-dependent thermal contact conductance model to represent the pebble–wall interactions has been implemented in the FE code ABAQUS. First, the current material model has been verified by uniaxial compression and creep experiments under a wide range of temperature fields, and good agreement between experiments and theory has been achieved. The HELICA mock-up has been modelled by 2D generalized plane strain elements, and analyzed in ABAQUS. The results show that the temperature and mechanical fields obtained in FE analysis agree well with the measurements by thermo-couples and LVDTs located at different positions.},

abstract = {Parabolic trough solar technology has been proven at nine commercial Solar Electric Generating Systems (SEGS) power plants that are operating in the California Mojave desert. These plants utilize steam Rankine cycle power plants, and as a result, most people associate parabolic trough solar technology with steam Rankine cycle power plant technology. Although these plants are clearly optimized for their particular application, other power cycle designs may be appropriate in other situations. Of particular interest is the integration of parabolic trough solar technology with combined cycle power plant technology. This configuration is referred to as integrated solar combined cycle systems (ISCCS). Four potential projects in India, Egypt, Morocco, and Mexico are considering the ISCCS type solar power cycle configurations. The key questions are when is the ISCCS configuration preferred over the SEGS power cycle configuration and how is the ISCCS plant designed to optimize the integration of the solar field and the power cycle. This paper reviews the results of a collaborative effort under the International Energy Agency SolarPACES organization to address these questions and it shows the potential environmental and economic benefits of each configuration.},

abstract = {In the frame of the activities of the European Test Blanket Module Consortium of Associates the Helium-Cooled Pebble-Bed Test Blanket Module (HCPB TBM) is developed in Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe (FZK) to investigate DEMO relevant concepts for blanket modules. A series of four different HCPB TBMs of the EU will be installed into the ITER Vacuum Vessel connected to one dedicated equatorial port. During different test campaigns, the 4 TBMs will test the three main functions of a blanket module (removing heat, breeding tritium and shielding sensitive components from radiation). In 2006-2007 a preliminary version of the HCPB TBM sub-components design has been proposed extrapolating the neutronic analyses performed for the horizontal HCPB TBM. With the input data provided by the preliminary design, together with the ITER 3D 40° toroidal sector model, new nuclear analyses for the vertical HCPB TBM have been performed. Nuclear results are necessary to assess the sub-components design and to validate the design of the HCPB TBM: with this aim thermal analyses of a 1/4 scaled assembly of the vertical HCPB TBM have been performed. As the generation of data in ITER supporting the design of DEMO is very important in the road map to the commercial fusion reactor, the results of nuclear and thermal analyses are fundamental to perform studies concerning the TBM DEMO relevancy. © 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The objective of the ITER TBM Program is to provide the first experimental data on the performance of the breeding blankets in the integrated fusion nuclear environment. Such information is essential to design and predict the performance of DEMO and future fusion reactors. It foresees to test six mock-ups of breeding blankets, called Test Blanket Module (TBM), in three dedicated ITER equatorial ports from the beginning of the ITER operation. The TBM and its associated ancillary systems, including cooling system and tritium extraction system, forms the Test Blanket System (TBS) that will be fully integrated in the ITER machine and buildings. This paper describes the main features of the six TBSs that are presently planned for installation and operation in ITER, the main interfaces with other ITER systems and the main aspects of the TBM Program management. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Reimann:2001il,
abstract = {The description of thermal creep in ceramic breeder pebble bed blankets is of large importance for the calculation of the bed-structure mechanical interaction (BSMI) which is important for the assessment of the blanket lifetime. Results of thermal creep experiments with Li4SiO4 pebble beds (pebble diameters between 0.25 and 0.63 mm) are reported, performed in an uniaxial test facility at temperatures up to 850 °C and pressures up to 9 MPa. A correlation has been developed which describes thermal creep strain as a function of temperature, pressure and time. The temperature influence is, as expected, quite pronounced, the stress influence, however, is very small compared with homogeneous materials. For future BSMI calculations the proposed correlation is recommended to be used together with a correlation for the modulus of deformation at ambient temperature.},

abstract = {Fluid flows in porous media are ubiquitous in the shallow Earth environments.$\backslash$nThe resistivity of the porous medium to the flow of either a single$\backslash$nor multiphase fluid does not only effect the fluid discharge trough$\backslash$nthe porous medium, but also the transport of additional dissolved$\backslash$ncomponents or heat. In many instances, chemicals or heat drive reactions$\backslash$nat the fluid-solid interface. These reactions can affect the porous$\backslash$nmedia geometry at the pore-scale leading to a local change in permeability$\backslash$nand phases saturation. Reactions can therefore have a drastic effect$\backslash$non discharge of mass and advected quantities. In this thesis we aim$\backslash$nto better understand and quantify the complex coupling between the$\backslash$ndifferent physical processes that take place at the pore-scale for$\backslash$nboth single and multiphase fluids in isothermal and thermal reactive$\backslash$nenvironments. We do that by performing pore-scale numerical simulations$\backslash$nfor both single and multiphase fluids in synthetic porous media samples.$\backslash$nThe numerical algorithm we choose is the lattice Boltzmann method.},

abstract = {The effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds is an important parameter for the thermomechanical design of solid breeder blankets operating at temperatures of up to 900 °C in breeder pebble beds and up to 700 °C in beryllium pebble beds. Compressive stresses and creep might cause significant pebble deformations. The knowledge of the thermal conductivity as a function of bed deformation, therefore, is of prime importance. For strongly deformed pebble beds, only results for beryllium pebbles existed where the conductivity increased by a factor of about 5 for bed deformations of about 1\%. For ceramic breeder beds, the increase of the bed conductivity with increasing bed deformation is expected to be much smaller. Quantitative results were missing. This paper presents results on the thermal conductivity of lithium orthosilicate and different types of lithium metatitanate pebble beds (monsized and binary beds) for bed deformations up to 4.5\% and temperatures up to 800 °C using the pulsed hot wire technique. Most of the measurements at high temperatures were performed in air; at ambient temperature, helium and argon were also used. A distinct increase of the thermal conductivity with bed deformation was found: however, this effect is quite small compared to deformed beryllium beds and might be neglected at high temperatures. The results for zero bed deformation agree well with correlations from literature.},

abstract = {The Helium Cooled PebbleBed (HCPB) Blanket is one of the reference concepts for the European Breeding Blanket Programme for DEMO. In the reference blanket module, alternate layers of lithiated ceramics and beryllium pebbles act, respectively, as tritium breeder and neutron multiplier. The thermo-mechanicalbehaviour of both the pebblebeds and their performances in reactor relevant conditions are also dependent on the pebble size and cell geometries (bed thickness, pebble packing factor, bed thermal conductivity). Therefore, in the EU Fusion Technology Programme, several out-of-pile experimental test campaigns have been performed to determine these behaviours. Theoretical calculations have been also launched for the prediction of the thermal and mechanical performances of the pebblebeds under different testing conditions. More recently, among the EU Associations involved in the ceramic breeder qualification, a benchmarkexercise has been launched to select the pebblebed thermal mechanical constitutive models to be implemented in a FEM computer code. This paper describes the activities, carried out by ENEA and DIN, University of Palermo (I), for the first comparison with the results of the experiments carried out at HE-FUS 3 facility of ENEA Brasimone on the HELICA mock-up. The paper describes the test conditions and also presents the main experimental results and its first comparison with the theoretical calculations.},

In the HCPB blanket lithium orthosilicate pebbles in the diameter range 0.25–0.63 mm are placed in a gap of about 10-mm width between two cooling plates. Therefore, in order to study the heat transfer in the blanket, the effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds has to be known. Measurements of the heat transfer parameters of a Li4SiO4 pebble bed have been performed at the Research Centre of Karlsruhe (Germany). In the experimental apparatus the pebble bed is contained in the annular space between two concentric stainless steel tubes. The internal tube is electrically heated and the heat flows through the bed in radial direction. Thermocouples in the tubes and in the pebble bed measure the temperature distribution in axial and in radial direction respectively, thus allowing the calculation of the heat transfer parameters of the bed. Measurements were performed with helium flowing through the bed at very low velocity, so that the heat transfer parameters were not affected by gas convection. In this paper the measured thermal conductivity data are presented and discussed. Experiments with different helium pressures show that, for pressures higher than 1 bar, there is no effect of the pressure variation on the thermal conductivity of the pebble bed (Smoluchowski effect).},

abstract = {We quantified the microstructural disorder of packed beds and correlated it with the resulting eddy dispersion. For this purpose we designed a set of bulk (unconfined) monodisperse random sphere packings with a systematic, protocol-dependent degree of microstructural heterogeneity, covering a porosity range from the random-close to the random-loose packing limit ($\epsilon$ = 0.366-0.46). With the precise knowledge of particle positions, size, and shape we conducted a Voronoi\"{\i} tessellation of all packings and correlated the statistical moments of the Voronoi\"{\i} volume distributions (standard deviation and skewness) with the porosity and the protocol-dependent microstructural disorder. The deviation of the Voronoi\"{\i} volume distributions from the delta function of a crystalline packing describes the origin of short-range disorder of the investigated random packings. Eddy dispersion was simulated over a wide range of reduced velocities (0.5 ≤ $\nu$ ≤ 750) and analyzed with the comprehensive Giddings equation. Transient dispersion was found to correlate with the spatial scales of heterogeneity in the packings. The analysis of short-range disorder based on the Voronoi\"{\i} volume distributions revealed a strong correlation with the short-range interchannel contribution to eddy dispersion, whereas transchannel dispersion was relatively little affected. The presented approach defines a strictly scientific route to the key morphology-transport relationships of current and future chromatographic supports, including their morphological reconstruction, statistical analysis, and the correlation with relevant transport phenomena. It also guides us in our understanding, comparison, and optimization of the diverse packing algorithms and protocols used in simulations and experimental studies.},

The steady state aspect of the mission is reflected in the choice of superconducting magnets, provision of actively cooled in-vessel components, and long pulse current drive and heating systems. The advanced tokamak aspect of the mission is incorporated in the design features associated with flexible plasma shaping, double null divertor and passive stabilizers, internal control coils and a comprehensive set of diagnostics. Substantial progress in engineering has been made on superconducting magnets, the vacuum vessel, plasma facing components and power supplies. The new KSTAR experimental facility with cryogenic system and deionized water cooling and main power systems has been designed, and the construction work is under way for completion in 2004.},

The present material model of pebble beds, based on the modified Drucker-Prager-Cap model, has been implemented in the commercial finite element package, ABAQUS. The overall behaviour of the lithium orthosilicate cassette (HELICA) and the interactions of ceramic breeder pebble beds and beryllium pebble beds (HEXCALIBER) are studied numerically. The finite element analyses show the temperature distribution of the mock-up experiments, as well as the stress–strain fields. The predictions of HELICA mock-up are compared with the experiments, including the temperature measured by thermo-couples located inside the pebble beds and the lateral deformation of the cell.},

abstract = {A model for $\mu$m-sized grain–grain interaction is presented, which exhibits the essential features necessary to describe collision, agglomeration and fragmentation processes. The model has been efficiently implemented in the LAMMPS code. In addition to existing models, adhesive forces and — gliding, rolling, and torsional — friction processes are implemented. The code scales linearly with grain number up to ∼106 on a single processor and inherits the excellent parallelization features of the LAMMPS code on multi-processor machines. We validate the code by determining the velocity of sound of granular agglomerates.},

abstract = {We review recent developments in size separation in vibrated granular materials. Motivated by a need in industry to handle granular materials efficiently and a desire to make fundamental advances in non-equilibrium physics, experimental and theoretical investigations have shown size separation to be a complex phenomenon. Large particles in a vibrated granular system normally rise to the top. However, they may also sink to the bottom or show other patterns, depending on subtle variations in physical conditions. While size ratio is a dominant factor, particle-specific properties such as density, inelasticity and friction can play an important role. The nature of the energy input, boundary conditions and interstitial air have also been shown to be significant factors in determining spatial distributions. The presence of convection can enhance mixing or lead to size separation. Experimental techniques including direct visualization and magnetic resonance imaging are being used to investigate these properties. Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulation techniques have been developed to probe size separation. Analytical methods such as kinetic theory are being used to study the interplay between particle size and density in the vibro-fluidized regime, and geometric models have been proposed to describe size separation for deep beds. Besides discussing these studies, we will also review the impact of inelastic collisions and friction on the density and velocity distributions to gain a deeper appreciation of the non-equilibrium nature of the system. While a substantial number of studies have been performed, considerable work is still required to achieve a firm description of the phenomena.},

Deformation caused by the mechanical loading is partly relaxed when the bed is heated without the load. After a large numbers of thermal and mechanical loading cycles, the packing factor of the bed increased from the initial packing factor of 66.9\% to finally about 68.5\%. This progressive increase in packing leads to production of a cavity region at the top of the pebble bed, therefore it is important to obtain a high initial packing factor.},

@article{Latt2008,
abstract = {Various ways of implementing boundary conditions for the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations by a lattice Boltzmann method are discussed. Five commonly adopted approaches are reviewed, analyzed, and compared, including local and nonlocal methods. The discussion is restricted to velocity Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to straight on-lattice boundaries which are aligned with the horizontal and vertical lattice directions. The boundary conditions are first inspected analytically by applying systematically the results of a multiscale analysis to boundary nodes. This procedure makes it possible to compare boundary conditions on an equal footing, although they were originally derived from very different principles. It is concluded that all five boundary conditions exhibit second-order accuracy, consistent with the accuracy of the lattice Boltzmann method. The five methods are then compared numerically for accuracy and stability through benchmarks of two-dimensional and three-dimensional flows. None of the methods is found to be throughout superior to the others. Instead, the choice of a best boundary condition depends on the flow geometry, and on the desired trade-off between accuracy and stability. From the findings of the benchmarks, the boundary conditions can be classified into two major groups. The first group comprehends boundary conditions that preserve the information streaming from the bulk into boundary nodes and complete the missing information through closure relations. Boundary conditions in this group are found to be exceptionally accurate at low Reynolds number. Boundary conditions of the second group replace all variables on boundary nodes by new values. They exhibit generally much better numerical stability and are therefore dedicated for use in high Reynolds number flows.},

@article{Hernandez2014,
abstract = {One of the European blanket designs for ITER is the Helium Cooled Pebble Bed (HCPB) blanket. The core of the HCPB-TBM consists of so-called breeder units (BUs), which encloses beryllium as neutron multiplier and lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) as tritium breeder in form of pebble beds. After the design phase of the HCPB-BU, a non-nuclear thermal and thermo-mechanical qualification program for this device is running at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Before the complex full scale BU testing, a pre-test mock-up experiment (PREMUX) has been constructed, which consists of a slice of the BU containing the Li4SiO4 pebble bed. PREMUX is going to be operated under highly ITER-relevant conditions and has the following goals: (1) as a testing rig of new heater concept based on a matrix of wire heaters, (2) as benchmark for the existing finite element method (FEM) codes used for the thermo-mechanical assessment of the Li4SiO 4 pebble bed, and (3) in situ measurement of thermal conductivity of the Li4SiO4 pebble bed during the tests. This paper describes the construction of PREMUX, its rationale and the experimental campaign planned with the device. Preliminary results testing the algorithm used for the temperature reconstruction of the pebble bed are reported and compared qualitatively with first analyses completed with the FEM codes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Compared with liposomes, use of polymeric building blocks for membrane formation allows increased stability, stimuli responsiveness and chemical diversity, which may prove advantageous for drug-delivery applications . A major drawback of most polymeric vesicles is the lack of biofunctionality, which restricts their ability to interact with cells and tissues. We have prepared vesicles composed of polyarginine and polyleucine segments that are stable in media, can entrap water soluble species, and can be processed to different sizes and prepared in large quantities. The remarkable feature of these materials is that the polyarginine segments both direct structure for vesicle formation and provide functionality for efficient intracellular delivery of the vesicles. This unique synergy between nanoscale self-assembly and inherent peptide functionality provides a new approach for design of multifunctional materials for drug delivery.},

A main reason for the lack of successful stem cell therapies is the difficulty in fully recreating the maintenance and control of the native stem cell niche. Improving the performance of transplanted stem cells therefore requires a better understanding of the cellular mechanisms guiding stem cell behavior in both native and engineered three-dimensional (3D) microenvironments. Most techniques, however, for uncovering mechanisms controlling cell behavior in vitro have been developed using 2D cell cultures and are of limited use in 3D environments such as engineered tissue constructs. Deciphering the mechanisms controlling stem cell fate in native and engineered 3D environments, therefore, requires rigorous quantitative techniques that permit mechanistic, hypothesis-driven studies of cell-microenvironment interactions. Here, we review the current understanding of 2D and 3D stem cell control mechanisms and propose an approach to uncovering the mechanisms that govern stem cell behavior in 3D.},

@article{Muschler2004a,
abstract = {Tissue engineering is a rapidly evolving discipline that seeks to repair, replace, or regenerate specific tissues or organs by translating fundamental knowledge in physics, chemistry, and biology into practical and effective materials, devices, systems, and clinical strategies. Stem cells and progenitors that are capable of forming new tissue with one or more connective tissue phenotypes are available from many adult tissues and are defined as connective tissue progenitors. There are four major cell-based tissue-engineering strategies: (1) targeting local connective tissue progenitors where new tissue is desired, (2) transplanting autogenous connective tissue progenitors, (3) transplanting culture-expanded or modified connective tissue progenitors, and (4) transplanting fully formed tissue generated in vitro or in vivo. Stem cell function is controlled by changes in stem cell activation and self-renewal or by changes in the proliferation, migration, differentiation, or survival of the progeny of stem cell activation, the downstream progenitor cells. Three-dimensional porous scaffolds promote new tissue formation by providing a surface and void volume that promotes the attachment, migration, proliferation, and desired differentiation of connective tissue progenitors throughout the region where new tissue is needed. Critical variables in scaffold design and function include the bulk material or materials from which it is made, the three-dimensional architecture, the surface chemistry, the mechanical properties, the initial environment in the area of the scaffold, and the late scaffold environment, which is often determined by degradation characteristics. Local presentation or delivery of bioactive molecules can change the function of connective tissue progenitors (activation, proliferation, migration, differentiation, or survival) in a manner that results in new or enhanced local tissue formation. All cells require access to substrate molecules (oxygen, glucose, and amino acids). A balance between consumption and local delivery of these substrates is needed if cells are to survive. Transplanted cells are particularly vulnerable. Theoretical calculations can be used to explore the relationships among cell density, diffusion distance, and cell viability within a graft and to design improved strategies for transplantation of connective tissue progenitors. Rational strategies for tissue engineering seek to optimize new tissue formation through the logical selection of conditions that modulate the performance of connective tissue progenitors in a graft site to produce a desired tissue. This increasingly involves strategies that combine cells, matrices, inductive stimuli, and techniques that enhance the survival and performance of local or transplanted connective tissue progenitors.},

The osteogenic potential of bone marrow stromal (BMS) cells has been documented. This study investigates the in vivo osteogenic capability of adipose-derived adult stromal (ADAS) cells, BMS cells, calvarial-derived osteoblasts and dura mater cells to heal critical-size mouse calvarial defects. Implanted, apatite-coated, PLGA scaffolds seeded with ADAS or BMS cells produced significant intramembranous bone formation by 2 weeks and areas of complete bony bridging by 12 weeks as shown by X-ray analysis, histology and live micromolecular imaging. The contribution of implanted cells to new bone formation was 84-99\% by chromosomal detection. These data show that ADAS cells heal critical-size skeletal defects without genetic manipulation or the addition of exogenous growth factors.},

abstract = {Nuclear transplantation (therapeutic cloning) could theoretically provide a limitless source of cells for regenerative therapy. Although the cloned cells would carry the nuclear genome of the patient, the presence of mitochondria inherited from the recipient oocyte raises questions about the histocompatibility of the resulting cells. In this study, we created bioengineered tissues from cardiac, skeletal muscle, and renal cells cloned from adult bovine fibroblasts. Long-term viability was demonstrated after transplantation of the grafts into the nuclear donor animals. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and western blot analysis confirmed that the cloned tissues expressed tissue-specific mRNA and proteins while expressing a different mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotype. In addition to creating skeletal muscle and cardiac "patches", nuclear transplantation was used to generate functioning renal units that produced urinelike fluid and demonstrated unidirectional secretion and concentration of urea nitrogen and creatinine. Examination of the explanted renal devices revealed formation of organized glomeruli- and tubule-like structures. Delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) testing in vivo and Elispot analysis in vitro suggested that there was no rejection response to the cloned renal cells. The ability to generate histocompatible cells using cloning techniques addresses one of the major challenges in transplantation medicine.},

@article{Richardson2001a,
abstract = {The development of tissues and organs is typically driven by the action of a number of growth factors. However, efforts to regenerate tissues (e.g., bone, blood vessels) typically rely on the delivery of single factors, and this may partially explain the limited clinical utility of many current approaches. One constraint on delivering appropriate combinations of factors is a lack of delivery vehicles that allow for a localized and controlled delivery of more than a single factor. We report a new polymeric system that allows for the tissue-specific delivery of two or more growth factors, with controlled dose and rate of delivery. The utility of this system was investigated in the context of therapeutic angiogenesis. We now demonstrate that dual delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-165 and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB, each with distinct kinetics, from a single, structural polymer scaffold results in the rapid formation of a mature vascular network. This is the first report of a vehicle capable of delivery of multiple angiogenic factors with distinct kinetics, and these results clearly indicate the importance of multiple growth factor action in tissue regeneration and engineering.},

abstract = {A family of injectable, rapid gelling and highly flexible hydrogel composites capable of releasing insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and delivering mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) were developed. Hydrogel composites were fabricated from Type I collagen, chondroitin sulfate (CS) and a thermosensitive and degradable hydrogel copolymer based on N-isopropylacrylamide, acrylic acid, N-acryloxysuccinimide and a macromer poly(trimethylene carbonate)-hydroxyethyl methacrylate. The hydrogel copolymer was gellable at body temperature before degradation and soluble at body temperature after degradation. Hydrogel composites exhibited LCSTs around room temperature. They could easily be injected through a 26-gauge needle at 4 degrees C, and were capable of gelling within 6s at 37 degrees C to form highly flexible gels with moduli matching those of the rat and human myocardium. The hydrogel composites showed good oxygen permeability; the oxygen pressure within the hydrogel composites was similar to that in the air. The effects of collagen and CS contents on LCST, gelation time, injectability, mechanical properties and degradation properties were investigated. IGF-1 was loaded into the hydrogel composites for enhanced cell survival/growth. The released IGF-1 remained bioactive during a 2-week release period. Small fraction of CS in the hydrogel composites significantly decreased IGF-1 release rate. The release kinetics appeared to be controlled mainly by hydrogel composite water content, degradation and interaction with IGF-1. Human MSC adhesion on the hydrogel composites was comparable to that on the tissue culture plate. MSCs were encapsulated in the hydrogel composites and were found to grow inside during a 7-day culture period. IGF-1 loading significantly accelerated MSC growth. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MSCs maintained their multipotent differentiation potential in hydrogel composites with and without IGF-1. These injectable and rapid gelling hydrogel composites demonstrated attractive properties for serving as growth factor and cell carriers for cardiovascular tissue engineering applications.},

abstract = {The treelike structures of many organs, including the mammary gland, are generated by branching morphogenesis, a reiterative process of branch initiation and invasion from a preexisting epithelium. Using a micropatterning approach to control the initial three-dimensional structure of mouse mammary epithelial tubules in culture, combined with an algorithm to quantify the extent of branching, we found that the geometry of tubules dictates the position of branches. We predicted numerically and confirm experimentally that branches initiate at sites with a local minimum in the concentration of autocrine inhibitory morphogens, such as transforming growth factor-beta. These results reveal that tissue geometry can control organ morphogenesis by defining the local cellular microenvironment, a finding that has relevance to control of invasion and metastasis.},

@article{Murphy2002a,
abstract = {Macroporous scaffolds composed of biodegradable polymers have found extensive use as three-dimensional substrates either for in vitro cell seeding followed by transplantation, or as conductive substrates for direct implantation in vivo. Methods abound for creation of macroporous scaffolds for tissue engineering, and common methods typically employ a solid porogen within a three-dimensional polymer matrix to create a well-defined pore size, pore structure, and total scaffold porosity. This study describes an approach to impart improved pore interconnectivity to polymer scaffolds for tissue engineering by partially fusing the solid porogen together prior to creation of a continuous polymer matrix. Three dimensional, porous scaffolds of the copolymer 85:15 poly(lactide-co-glycolide) were fabricated via either a solvent casting/particulate leaching process, or a gas foaming/particulate leaching process. Prior to creation of a continuous polymer matrix the NaCl crystals, which serve as the solid porogen, are partially fused via treatment in 95\% humidity. Scanning electron micrographs clearly display fused salt crystals and an enhancement in pore interconnectivity in the salt fused scaffolds prepared via both solvent casting and gas foaming, and the extent of pore interconnectivity is enhanced with longer treatment times. Fusion of salt crystal for 24 h increased the radius of curvature of salt crystals, and led to a twofold increase in the compressive modulus of solvent cast scaffolds (total porosity of 97 +/- 1\%). Fusion of NaCl crystals prior to gas foaming resulted in a decrease in scaffold compressive modulus from 277 +/- 60k Pa to 187 +/- 30k Pa (total porosity of 94 +/- 1\%). The resulting highly interconnected scaffolds have implications for facilitated cell migration, abundant cell-cell interaction, and potentially improved neural and vascular growth within tissue engineering scaffolds.},

abstract = {ES (embryonic stem) cell differentiation is dependent on the presence of HS (heparan sulfate). We have demonstrated that, during differentiation, the evolution of specific cell lineages is associated with particular patterns of GAG (glycosaminoglycan) expression. For example, different HS epitopes are synthesized during neural or mesodermal lineage formation. Cell lines mutant for various components of the HS biosynthetic pathway are selectively impaired in their differentiation, with lineage-specific effects observed for some lines. We have also observed that the addition of soluble GAG saccharides to cells, with or without cell-surface HS, can influence the pace and outcome of differentiation, again highlighting specific pattern requirements for particular lineages. We are combining this work with ongoing studies into the design of artificial cell environments where we have optimized three-dimensional scaffolds, generated by electrospinning or by the formation of hydrogels, for the culture of ES cells. By permeating these scaffolds with defined GAG oligosaccharides, we intend to control the mechanical environment of the cells (via the scaffold architecture) as well as their biological signalling environment (using the oligosaccharides). We predict that this will allow us to control ES cell pluripotency and differentiation in a three-dimensional setting, allowing the generation of differentiated cell types for use in drug discovery/testing or in therapeutics.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior and properties of particle beds relevant to fusion ceramic breeder blanket designs are addressed through a combination of experimental and analytical studies. A series of uniaxial compression tests are performed in a INSTRON hydraulic-press test facility in which compressive loads are applied to Li2ZrO3 and aluminum packed beds. The experimental data shows that the mechanical properties such as the bed effective modulus are stress dependent and consistent with the analytical model predictions. Nevertheless, the experimental data shows that the bed effective modulus is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that of the solid material.},

@article{Abou-Sena2007,
abstract = {Tritium breeding materials, which have the ability to react with neutrons and produce tritium, are required to fuel fusion reactions. Tritium is produced inside the fusion blanket by neutron irradiation of lithium ceramics (tritium breeders). Using the lithium ceramics in form of pebbles-packed bed is a promising concept for fusion blankets, and worldwide efforts have been dedicated to its R\&D. Thermal properties of lithium ceramic pebble beds have a significant impact upon the thermal performance of the fusion blanket. Specifically, the effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramic pebble beds is important for the design and analysis of fusion blankets. The experimental apparatus of this study was designed and built based on the principles of the steady state and axial heat flow methods in order to conduct the required measurements. The objective of this study is to measure the effective thermal conductivity of a Li2TiO3 pebble bed as a function of the average bed temperature. The pebble bed has pebbles of 1.7–2.0 mm diameter and a packing fraction of 61\%. Helium at atmospheric pressure was used as a filling gas. The experimental results showed that the effective thermal conductivity decreased from 1.40 to 0.94 W/m K with the increase of the average bed temperature from 50 to 500 °C. The results presented in this work will help to create a database of the effective thermal conductivity of Li2TiO3 pebble beds which can be used for the design and analysis of fusion blankets.},

abstract = {Within the framework of the ITER Test Blanket Working Group, the ITER Parties have made several proposals for test blanket modules to be tested in ITER from the first day of H–H operation. This paper gives an overview of the proposed TBMs designs, of the ITER boundary conditions and of the expected TBM operating conditions. Operating conditions will vary throughout the various ITER phases, starting from the initial H–H phase where no neutrons and, therefore, no nuclear volume heating will be present, to the later D–T phase where pulses of up to 3000 s length may be expected. The paper is focused on the design requirements for the materials and subcomponents that will be used in the various TBMs, from the viewpoint of both the materials performance and the required R\&D.},
