\section{DEM study: effective conductivity with disrupted packing}
\label{sec:dem-studies-effective-conductivity}

\subsection{Model Setup \& Methodology}\label{sec:dem-setup}
We analyze a three-dimensional pebble bed consisting of mono-dispersed particles of diameter $d_p$. The particles are constrained by rigid $y-z$-planes at locations of $\frac{x}{d_p} = \pm 10$ (the walls of our container). There are periodic boundary conditions in the $y$-direction located at $\frac{y}{d_p} = \pm 7.5$. Gravity acts in the negative $z$-direction and the particles are resting on a rigid $x-y$-plane at $z=0$ (the floor of the container) and held from the top by an $x-y$-plane at $\frac{z}{d_p} = 30$ (the roof of the container). We pack to $\phi = 64\%$ and, given the volume, have 11000 particles. The volume was chosen to represent the long, tall, narrow channels seen in many solid breeder module designs\cite{ Cho2008, Poitevin2010, Enoeda2003}.

For this study, the material properties were chosen to represent lithium metatinatate pebbles. All the properties come from Ref.~\cite{Gierszewski1998}. They are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:mat-props}

In the first attempt at packing pebbles into the system, we begin with a common starting point of a filled, lightly packed volume of 10~550 pebbles. We simulate pouring the pebbles into the volume by initializing them into the system from a height of $\frac{z}{d_p} \approx 50$ and allow them to fall under the influence of gravity (see Fig.~\ref{fig:fill01}). We pack the pebbles into a higher packing fraction by means of oscillating the walls as if the pebble bed were sitting on a vibrating plate. This was to imitate the vibration packing technique done in our experimental lab when testing pebble beds in the uniaxial compression test stand. The vibration scheme was able to slowly densify the packed bed but, owing to the very small timestep of the simulation, the simulation times were impractically large to approach a packing fraction greater than $\phi = 60\%$.

In the end, a simpler pack-relax method was used instead. In this method $N$ particles are inserted into the volume such that we have precisely the packing fraction we desire (in this case, $\phi = 64\%$ so $N = 11000$). The pebbles are placed at random into the volume and are allowed to artificially overlap -- often by a great deal ($\delta \sim R_p$). The overlap they experience would normally cause such an enormous force (integrating into an enormous velocity) that the pebbles would all explode out of the bed at the first step in time integration. We avoid such a catostrophic scenario with a relaxation scheme where we truncate the displacement of any pebble per timestep that is integrated from the force. The truncated displacement is very small and allows the pebbles to slowly move away from each other and into a static equilibirum as the artifical overlap is reduced. Once the pebble bed comes to rest, we remove the relaxation (limiting displacement command) and allow standard integration of contact forces with the velocity-Verlet algorithm (see \cref{sec:velocity-verlet}). The pack-relax scheme allowed for obtaining desireable, highly repeatable packing fractions for all pebble beds. Once the pebble bed was packed into an initial condition, the simulation state was saved and used as a starting point for the numerous `crushed' cases to be described later.

In this first study, we model pebble crushing without considering why the particular pebble should be cracking. In the model we randomly select pebbles from the ensemble, regardless of forces acting upon the pebble, and delete them entirely from the system. When a pebble is removed, the neighboring pebbles react due to the imbalance of forces, and the bed settles into a new configuration. We differentiated the failed beds by their percentage of failed pebbles: $\eta = $ number of failed pebbles per original ensemble size. For the baseline case and for beds after failing, we apply the heating routine described next.

To simulate the conditions of a solid breeder in a fusion reactor, where the heat is removed from the pebble bed via contact to the containing structure, we assigned a constant temperature of $T_\text{c}$ to the vertical walls. Nuclear heating of the pebbles is simulated through a constant source term on each pebble. A representative heating rate of $Q_s = q_p'''V_p$, where  $q_p'''= 8$ MW/m$^3$. The heating cycle runs until a thermal steady state is reached. Based on a measurement of the total thermal energy of the bed, $E_T =\sum_i^N m_iC_i T_i$, steady-state is determined as $\dt{E_T} = 0$ within a specified tolerance. Once at steady state, we analyzed thermal and mechanical characteristics of the pebble bed: effective thermal conductivity, average coordination number, temperature profiles in the bed, and inter-particle contact forces. 

Based on the boundary conditions to our system, we establish heat transfer that is symmetric and one-dimensional in the $x$-direction from $x=0$ to the walls at $\frac{x}{d_p} = \pm 10$. As we will show, the pebble bed has very little variation of forces and temperatures in the $y$-direction due to the periodic boundary condition at the edges of the domain. Gravity effects are minor in the overall heat transfer and induce only a slight $z$-dependency to the results. We take advantage of this nature of our pebble bed to find the effective conductivity from an analytic, one-dimensional test case.

\subsection{Effective Thermal Conductivity from Analytic Analogy}
Assuming a one-dimensional pebble bed, to find an effective conductivity, we step back into a continuum mechanics formulation where the pebble bed can be represented as a slab of solid material. We can analytically solve for the temperature equation in a slab with heat generation, symmetry about the centerline, and a constant boundary temperature condition.

At steady-state, the temperature of a material with constant temperature boundary conditions ($T(L) = T_s$), constant thermal conductivity ($k_\text{eff}$), and nuclear heating ($q'''$) obeys the following equation

\begin{equation}\label{eq:continuum-heateqn}
	0 = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2T}{\mathrm{d}x^2} + \frac{q'''}{k_\text{eff}}
\end{equation}

We introduce a non-dimensional temperature
\begin{equation}
	\theta = \frac{T(x) - T_s}{T_0 - T_s}
\end{equation}
where $T_0$ is the temperature at the centerline of this slab (a value we will find momentarily). The length is non-dimensionalized as
\begin{equation}
	x^* = \frac{x}{L}
\end{equation}

Thus we can re-write Eq.~\ref{eq:continuum-heateqn} as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:continuum-heateqn-nondim}
	0 = \frac{\mathrm{d}^2\theta}{\mathrm{d}x^{*2}} + G
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	G = \frac{q'''L^2}{k_\text{eff}(T_0 - T_s)}
\end{equation}

In the non-dimensional form of Eq.~\ref{eq:continuum-heateqn-nondim}, the solution is purely geometric,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:continuum-temperature-nondim}
	\theta = 1-x^{*2}
\end{equation}. 
when $T_0 = T_s + \frac{q'''L^2}{2k_\text{eff}}$. We will use the non-dimensional temperature solution of Eq.~\ref{eq:continuum-temperature-nondim} to prove our one-dimensional assumption of heat transfer is justified for the pebble beds.

We note that in this continuum mechanics formulation, we are assuming that the nuclear source, $q'''$ term is applied evenly over the entire volume. In our DEM formulation, our source term applies to a single pebble. To find the effective thermal conductivity of our `slab' of pebble bed, we must reconcile this discrepency. This is accomplished with the exchange of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:q-source-translation}
	q''' = \frac{Q_\text{tot}}{V_\text{tot}} = \frac{Q_sN}{H\cdot L\cdot W\cdot d_p^2}
\end{equation}
where the pebble bed volume is given by the height, $H$, width, $W$, and length, $L$, and $Q_s$ is the source term on each pebble in the DEM ensemble. 

From the solution of Eq.~\ref{eq:continuum-heateqn-nondim}, we find the effective conductivity to be
\begin{equation}
	k_\text{eff} = \frac{q''' L^2}{2(T_0-T_s)}
\end{equation}
and when we replace the heat generation term with Eq.~\ref{eq:q-source-translation}, and use the bed dimensions as given in \cref{sec:dem-setup}, this is written as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dem-effecitve-conductivity-formula}
	k_\text{eff} = \frac{Q_sN}{180(T_0-T_s)d_p}
\end{equation}

We will use this formulation of Eq.~\ref{eq:dem-effecitve-conductivity-formula} to analyze and compare the pebble beds of this study.

\subsection{Results}
The aim of this study was both to discover the impact of pebble failure on thermomechanical properties as well as determine the impact as a function of the number of failed pebbles. To satisfy the latter, we created beds with $\eta = 1\%$, $5\%$, $10\%$, and $15\%$ of pebbles failed. 

We plot Eq.~\ref{eq:continuum-temperature-nondim} against the non-dimensionalized temperature profiles coming from the steady-state DEM simulation in Fig.~\ref{fig:tempProfile}. We find that all our models had a nearly perfect match to a one-dimensional prediction, validating the calculation of effective thermal conductivity in this study. Furthmore, the profiles adhering to the one-dimensional curve also allows us to find the effective conductivity of each bed from applying Eq.~\ref{eq:dem-effecitve-conductivity-formula}, which was derived from the one-dimensional assumption.

One concern we had for pebble crushing, was the phenomenon of `jamming' during resettling that would possibly leave pebbles isolated from their neighbors (apart from those they are resting upon). Such an isolated pebble would have no strong pathway for heat transfer and heat up much higher than that of its neighbors. Evidence of pebble isolation and `hot-spots' would be apparent in Fig.~\ref{fig:tempProfile} as localized deviations of data points from the quadratic profile. However, no deviations are seen in the data and we conclude that hot-spots will not be a concern in a packed bed.

	\caption{The nondimensional temperature profiles for each test case follow the theoretical shape of a one-dimensional, constant $k$, continuum solution.}
\label{fig:tempProfile}
\end{figure}

We first compare steady-state temperature profiles in the test beds against the one-dimensional theory of Eq.\ref{eq:continuum-heateqn-nondim}. To find the temperature profile in $x$, we create volumes of width $\Delta x$ that extend through the limits of the $y$- and $z$-directions. We then find the $n$ pebbles residing in the slices and take the mean value of their temperatures, 
\begin{equation}
	\langle T\rangle = \sum_{i}^n T_i / n	
\end{equation}
Using the volume slices, we also find the average coordination number, 
\begin{equation}
	\langle Z \rangle = \sum_{i}^n Z_i / n
\end{equation}
normalized average contact force, 
\begin{equation}
	\langle F^* \rangle=\left[\langle F \rangle/\langle F_{bl} \rangle_\text{max}\right]^{1/3}
\end{equation}
and the normalized average temperature difference between pebbles in the slice,
\begin{equation}
	 \langle \Delta T_{ij} \rangle / (T_0 - T_s)_\text{bl}
\end{equation}
Below we will omit the notation $\langle T \rangle$ with the understanding that temperatures are volume-averages.

\end{figure}


The effective thermal conductivity is found for all of our pebble beds, via Eq.~\ref{eq:etc}, then normalized against the conductivity of the baseline ensemble ($k_\text{eff}^* = k_\text{failed}/k_\text{bl}$). Figure~\ref{fig:packingFraction} shows the decreasing ETC with pebble failure. When $15\%$ of the pebbles are crushed in a pebble bed, the ETC has fallen all the way to only $k_\text{eff}^*=0.30$. This large reduction is especially important in light of the already poor thermal management of virgin pebble beds that, even in helium environments, have been experimentally measured at only approximately 1~W/m-K (see, { e.g.}, Refs.~\cite{Reimann:2002mi, Piazza2002}). In well-packed pebble beds, the ETC is generally related to the packing fraction. In Fig.~\ref{fig:packingFraction}, this relationship seems weak as the effective conductivity drops much more rapidly than does the packing fraction as the number of broken pebbles in the ensemble increases. To find the cause of decrease in conductivity and to make use of the information provided by DEM tools, we look to other parameters than the packing fraction.

From Eq.~\ref{eq:thermoFirstLaw}, in the steady-state, the energy input by nuclear heating must be balanced by the transport of heat out of a pebble into its neighbors. Inter-particle heat transfer is dictated by the number of neighboring contacts, temperature difference between pebbles, and the thermal conductance, $h_{ij}$ through the contact area. The thermal conductance is, itself, a function of material properties  (which are essentially constant here) and the force at the contact, going as $h_{ij} \propto F_n^{1/3}$. Thus, the net heat out is a function of the three variables as

\begin{equation}
	Q_\text{net} =f( Z, F_n^{1/3}, \Delta T)
\end{equation}



The variables affecting $Q_\text{net}$ are plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:coordProfiles}. The average coordination number, shown in the bottom plot, decreases from a mid-line value of about 7.0 at the steady-state of the baseline case down to a mid-line value of 5.5 for the 15\% failed bed; a reduction of about 80\%. But this number doesn't compare with the large reduction in ETC which was $k_\text{eff}^*=0.30$. Clearly, there are fewer contacts in the pebble bed after failure but this alone does not account for the reduction in ETC.

Much more dramatic, seen in the center plot, is the reduction in average normal force seen by pebbles after many of the neighbors fail and are removed from the system. From the baseline down to the 15\% failed case, the contact forces are dramatically reduced to about $\langle F^* \rangle=0.1$.This reduction in force is joined by an increase in average neighbor temperatures which are 3 times higher for the bed with most failed pebbles when compared to the baseline. 

The results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:coordProfiles} demonstrate that the heat transfer through a pebble bed is simultaneously a function of the coordination number and inter-particle contact forces -- which are both reduced as pebbles in the bed fail -- as well as the temperature difference between pebbles at steady state -- which increases as pebbles in the ensemble fail. Interestingly, when a pebble bed has lower overall inter-particle contact forces fewer particles would be expected to break. This would imply that pebble breakage is self-dampening; as pebbles begin to break the ensemble quickly relaxes and avoids future pebble failure. So while we induced failure up to $\eta = 15\%$, such large values may not occur in real beds. 

Another feature of Fig.~\ref{fig:coordProfiles} worth noting is the increase in averaged normal contact forces near the center of the bed relative to the walls. In the assumptions used to develop this simulation, we had noted the lack of localized force concentrations in a bed under an external mechanical load. However, in these results, owing to the nuclear heating temperature profile and thermal expansion of each pebble, there is a bias toward higher forces in the center of the bed. This result highlights the need for a model to predict failure initiation in place of the assumption of random pebble failure. 
%There are dramatic decreases near the walls for two reasons. The first being that contact of a pebble with a wall is not counted in the overall coordination number. The second is the forced ordering that pebbles experience near walls that is absent from the random packing in the bulk. Away from the walls, there is a clear decreasing trend in the coordination number as the pebble failure increases. From Eq.~\ref{eq:thermoFirstLaw}, the heat transfer from a pebble is a function of the number of neighbors with which the pebble is in contact.
