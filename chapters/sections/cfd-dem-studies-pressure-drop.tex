\subsection{Pressure Drop}

Before analyzing thermal results from the CFD-DEM coupling, the system was run at various particle Reynolds numbers and the overall pressure drop of the packed bed was measured with a varied constant inlet velocity. This value was compared against the well-known Kozeny-Carman and Ergun equations; however the Kozeny-Carman is known to fit better with experimental data at very small Reynolds numbers. In Fig.~\ref{fig:cfdem-pressure-drop} we see the CFD-DEM coupling model is providing bed-scale pressure drops that match very well with Kozeny-Carman over the Reynoldâ€™s numbers applicable to helium purge flow in fusion reactors. This is the sole validation effort performed on the CFD-DEM tool.
