\section{Pressure Drop}
Before analyzing thermal results from the CFD-DEM coupling, the system was run at various particle Reynolds numbers and the overall pressure drop of the packed bed was measured. This value was compared against the well-known Kozeny-Carman and Ergun equations. The Kozeny-Carman is known to fit better with experimental data at very small Reynolds numbers. In Fig. 1 we see the CFD-DEM coupling model is providing bed-scale pressure drops that match very well with Kozeny-Carman over the Reynoldâ€™s numbers applicable to helium purge flow in fusion reactors.
The flow is visualized in Fig. 2. The pebble bed is clipped at the centerline to allow viewing of the helium streamlines. Apparent in the figure is temperature profiles in the helium from centerline to wall that qualitatively mirror temperature profiles in the pebble bed.
