\section{Scope of the Work}\label{sec:intro-scope-of-work}
The objective of this dissertation is to develop numerical models of ceramic pebble beds, based on first principles and experimental observations, to simulate the hysteritic evolution of pebble bed morphology and predict the subsequent changes to heat transport characteristics after thermally-induced damage to pebbles. The numerical tools are constructed in the following progression: 1. Transient DEM code of inter-particle interactions is employed to simulate packed bed restructuring in the wake of crushed pebbles in the ensemble -- and the effective thermal conductivity following the restructuring, 2. Transient, volume-averaged equations of Navier-Stokes and energy of the helium purge gas are coupled to the DEM model of pebbles to simulate conjugate heat transfer and the interstitial fluid influence on thermophysical properties after crushing events, 3) Complete simulations of the tortuous path of helium purge gas with lattice-Boltzmann models (based on the packing structure determined in DEM simulations) to expose flattened temperature profiles due to laminar mixing in the pebble bed. 

A thorough understanding of the evolution of pebble bed morphology and the impact on thermophysical properties is critical for solid breeder designers. The understanding allows for temperature control of breeder pebble beds over the entire lifetime of the blanket which is crucial to the function of the solid breeder for tritium and energy generation. Thus we aim to provide designers of packed beds with tools to understand how packing states may evolve from time-dependent phenomena (e.g. sintering, creep, pebble cracking, etc.). These phenomena may, for instance: decrease the effective thermal conductivity which will raise bed temperatures beyond initial predictions, produce isolated pebbles which will sinter and potentially decrease tritium release rates, or even form gaps between pebble beds and containing structures leading to divergence from properties of the initial packing of the bed.

The objective of this work fits into the broader mission of our research group in the UCLA Fusion Science and Technology Center to develop and apply complete numerical models of ceramic pebble bed solid breeder modules. Any complete numerical model for a pebble bed would require the interaction of many sub-models or sub-functions operating at disparate scales. To demonstrate, a possible top-level algorithm could proceed in the following way: To begin, one must have knowledge of the interaction of the pebble bed with the containing structure as they exist in a fusion environment. The interactions are generally analyzed via the finite element method to find internal stresses and temperature fields of the entirety of the pebble bed and surrounding container. After the internal fields are mapped into the bed, one would use the discrete element method (DEM) to interpret the macroscopic stress fields into the inter-particle forces. With the inter-particle forces and total absorbed thermal energy calculated, a prediction of the initiation and evolution of morphological changes (i.e. crushed pebbles, sintering, creep, etc.) to each computational volume. Following this, DEM would calculate new effective properties as a result of the morphological changes to the pebble bed region. Finally, the updated bed properties would feed back into the FEM formulation to update calculations in the macroscopic stress fields. While a suite of integrated numerical tools that follows this example algorithm is the ultimate goal of our group, the work of this dissertation is focused entirely on the development of pebble-scale simulations that are predominately in the realm of the discrete element method.

In the following subs-sections, we briefly outline the studies fitting into the scope of this dissertation. 

\subsection*{Discrete Element Method Study on the Evolution of thermo-mechanics of a Pebble Bed Experiencing Pebble Damage}
In the first study of \cref{sec:dem-studies}, we analyze the effective thermal conductivity of a pebble bed assuming different fractions of pebbles in the ensemble are completely crushed. The focus of this study is to 1) determine the extent of change, in aggregate, to ensemble properties due to individual pebble crushing, 2) relate the changes in effective conductivity to quantifiable pebble-scale properties (e.g. contact force, coordination number, etc.), 3) use the results to create guidelines for designers to anticipate acceptable limits of pebble loss from a thermal management point of view. For the DEM tools used in this study, the only mode of heat transfer considered is conduction between the solid particles. 


\subsection*{Coupling DEM Models of Ceramic Breeder Pebble Beds to Thermofluid Models of Helium Purge Gas Using Volume-averaged CFD}
In a fusion breeder, the helium purge gas winding through the interstitial gaps of the pebbles has a substantial contribution to overall heat transfer.\cite{Reimann:2002mi,Abou-Sena2005} The model of \cref{sec:dem-studies} is improved to include the flowing interstitial gas. In \cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies}, we continue to employ our DEM tools to provide particle-scale information such as contact force, but couple the pebbles to a volume-averaged computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code for the conjugate heat transfer simulation. The coupled CFD-DEM model is used to again simulate the heat transfer in packed beds of ceramic spheres that experience pebble crushing -- but now with a focus on highlighting the impact of a flowing interstitial helium purge gas when pebbles are crushed.


\subsection*{Lattice-Boltzmann Method Integrating DEM Packing Structures to Study Laminar Mixing}
The models to account for helium purge gas employed in the studies of \cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies,sec:applied-studies} assume effective drag or heat transfer coefficients for pebbles in a computational volume and then include the pebble influence through effective source/sink terms in the momentum and energy equations. The volume-averaged approach allows for simpler meshing of the fluid volume while still retaining much of the physical realism of the system. Complete models of the conjugate heat transfer of both the fluid moving through the tortuous interstitial gaps pebble beds pressing each other with small contact areas are intractable with current computational hardware and finite-element modeling techniques. To overcome deficiencies in computational power, in \cref{sec:modeling-lbm}, we apply a relatively new technique wherein a lattice-Boltzmann algorithm solves for complete flow fields and conjugate heat transfer of helium winding through a packed bed. The lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is a non-traditional fluid simulation technique that allows us to resolve pebble/pore-scale momentum and energy transfer. The LBM approach is applied to the same pebble beds analyzed in \cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies} to provide comparison between the two modeling techniques. Furthermore the LBM model, accounting for the complex helium purge gas pathways, provides more insight to the influence of helium on the heat transfer in the heat transfer of packed beds.





\subsection*{Modeling Tools to Study Coolant Designs of ITER Solid Breeder Module Volumes}
In the study of \cref{sec:applied-studies}, we apply our coupled helium-pebble computational tools to the analysis of ITER-relevant solid breeder geometries. In this study we consider the combined effects of pebble crushing, packing restructuring due to both gravity and the unbalanced force network in the pebble bed, and convection from helium purge gas on temperature profiles in solid breeders for different breeding configurations. Heat transfer out of the pebble bed relies on maintaining good pebble-pebble and pebble-wall contact. However, physical contact is interrupted to different degrees when a pebble bed responds to various amounts of individual crushed pebbles. Furthermore, the restructuring of the pebble bed after a pebble crushing event is, in part, dependent on gravity forces acting upon each pebble in the ensemble. We investigate two representative pebble bed configurations where heat is removed from the bed via inter-particle conduction, convection of purge gas, and contact between the pebble bed and its container. In the first, the coolant containing structural walls (heat transfer walls) are oriented parallel to the gravity vector. In the second configuration, the heat transfer walls are perpendicular to the direction of gravity. To simulate a crushed pebble, we replace the pebble with many smaller, non-cohesive elements while maintaining mass-conservation between the original solid pebble and crushed fragments. The fragments are then free to resettle into interstitial gaps and the rest of the bed resettles as determined by forces from gravity, contact of neighboring particles, and even the small influence of the moving purge gas. The thermo-fluid interaction with the helium purge gas will be included with volume-averaged Navier-Stokes and energy equations. The representative solid breeder volumes will be compared with respect to their temperature peaks and profiles and how those temperatures vary as a function of the percentage of crushed pebbles in the ensemble. The results can be used to optimize solid breeder pebble bed designs through the choice of breeding zone orientation relative to the gravity vector.
