The CFD-DEM formulation maintains calculations of pebble-pebble interactions while dynamically coupling to the helium flow. The model demonstrates the ability of helium gas to smooth out any hot spots predicted by pure-conduction DEM formulations. Further, the lattice-Boltzmann simulation, while not fully coupled to DEM, revealed important features of helium flow in volumetrically heated pebble beds â€“ mainly the smearing of temperature profiles along the paths of cooling.
