\section{Heat Transport in Packed Beds} \label{sec:modeling-heat-transfer}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In our analysis of the momentum of packed beds, we focused entirely on the exchange of momentum between a fluid passing through a packed bed. The mechanics of contacting particles will be dealt with entirely within the framework of the discrete element method, to be discussed in \cref{sec:modeling-dem}. But now as we move to analyze the heat transfer in a packed bed, we will consider both inter-particle modes of heat transfer as well as particle-fluid convection.

\end{figure}

Looking at the particle highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:peb-comp-ht}, we see many pathways for heat to be transferred inside the ensemble. The most significant are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Conduction through the contact area between contacting particles.
\item Conduction through the stagnant fluid between near, non-contacting particles.
\item Conduction through the stagnant fluid between contacting particles.
\item Advection of energy by the fluid to contacting- and downstream particles.
\item Radiation between the surfaces of contacting particles.
\item Radiation between particles of adjacent voids.
\item Heat generation internally in the particle.
\end{enumerate}

We will address the inter-particle conduction in \cref{sec:ht-pebble-conduction} wherein we derive a formula for heat conductance between contacting, elastic spheres. The complex interaction of energy in a particle with a fluid (conduction through film regions, convection with passing fluid, etc.) will all be dealt with using correlations for packed beds; this is done in \cref{sec:particle-convection}. We will briefly discuss some literature where researchers have dealt with the radiation between particles in a packed bed but do not include the terms in our current models. Finally, the last mode of heat transfer is trivially accounted for with a heat source term,

\begin{equation}\label{eq:nuclear-heating-term}
	Q_g = q'''V
\end{equation}

where $q'''$ is a known volumetric heating rate and $V$ is the volume of our particle. In practice, we will know a volumetric heating rate from the location and geometry of the solid breeder volume. The volume of the sphere is $V = \frac{\pi}{6} d_p^3$.

In the following sections we will expand upon the details of the modes of heat transfer considered for our packed beds. They forms of equations used will be written in a way as to be easily implemented directly into the DEM computational framework, to be discussed later in \cref{sec:modeling-dem}.

% The transient energy balance for an irradiated pebble, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:peb-comp-ht}, in a packed bed with flowing interstitial gas is given by Eq.~\ref{eq:single-pebble-energy},

% \begin{equation}\label{eq:single-pebble-energy}
% 	\rho V C \frac{\mathrm{d}T}{\mathrm{d}t} = \dot{Q}_g + \dot{Q}_\text{conduction} + \dot{Q}_\text{convection} + \dot{Q}_\text{radiation}
% \end{equation}
