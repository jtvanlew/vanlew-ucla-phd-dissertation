\section{Nusselt number for spheres in packed beds}\label{sec:particle-convection}
\subsection{Convection by interstitial gas}

Engineers have paid considerable attention to the calculation of convective heat transfer in packed beds. Correlations for determining the Nusselt number of a sphere in dilute and dense packings over a range of Reynolds and Prandtl number are available. We will cover the detail of many of these correlations in \S\ref{sec:}. The methods all come down to calculating Nusselt number to find the heat transfer coefficient and then computing the rate of heat transfer from convection as

\begin{equation}
	\dot{Q}_\text{convection} = -hA(T_s-T_f)
\end{equation}

where $T_s$ is the temperature of the solid with surface area, $A$, and $T_f$ is the local bulk temperature of the passing fluid. The negative sign is to maintain convention that energy transfer into the solid is positive.
