To realize the dream of controlled nuclear fusion, the two large challenges of the engineering of a working reactor must be faced: material of the plasma-facing ``first wall'' and breeding tritium for sustained thermonuclear burns. In this thesis, I hope to make an impact, however small, on the engineering of the latter. 

The first generation of thermonuclear fusion reactors will require reservoirs of tritium for their fuel cycle. Because tritium only exists in minute amounts in nature, the fusion reactor will generate, or ``breed'' from the transmutation of lithium into tritium. A design was proposed by Abdou et al\cite{Abdou1974d} in 1975 wherein the plasma would be surrounded by a so-called blanket of nonmobile, solid lithium. The lithium would be combined with refractory materials to maintain the solid phase at elevated temperatures. In the team since this proposal, the most extensively studied designs see the lithiated ceramic existing in a packed bed of spherical pebbles.

To date, the leading candidates for lithiated ceramic are \lit and \lis. Pebble beds of these materials have been chosen by many participants of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) for tritium generation studies.\cite{Lulewicz2002, Mandal2012a, Tsuchiya1998, Cho2012} The advantages of the pebble bed design include ease of uniformly assembling the solid into complex geometries, ease of tritium extraction from the porous bed via an interstitial purge of helium, and with the small size of pebbles being more resilient to thermal stresses than a solid brick of lithiated ceramic.\cite{Casadio2004} Nothing comes without a price, naturally, and there are many issues with pebble bed tritium breeders that must be understood and overcome.

In typical solid breeder modules, coolant fluid runs through the containing structure surrounding the pebble bed. A low-pressure, low-speed purge gas is pumped through the pebble bed to extract the tritium generated and transport it out of the blanket for processing. As nuclear energy is deposited into the poorly-conductive ceramic breeder material, the temperature climbs well above the containing structure. Heat is removed from the pebble bed predominately through inter-particle conduction (with a small contribution from convection of the purge gas) and contact conductance of many pebbles pressed against the containing surface. 

The thermophysical and thermomechanical properties of pebble beds have been studied extensively [cite many of the experimental papers]. From experimental measurements, and the assumption that a pebble bed can be treated as a continuous media, researchers have developed phenomonological formulas relating properties of pebble bed to other, measurable, macroscopic properties [cite many of the modeling papers]. For instance, an effective thermal conductivity can be given for the packed bed given a certain gas and stress on the bed. These effective material properties are useful for the design and qualification of tritium breeding modules. But it must be understood that the material properties of a pebble bed are a function of their history and will evolve in time as the morphological features of the pebble bed likewise evolve in time. Therefore there is a need to predict the morphological changes to the pebble bed and the subsequent impact on the bed's thermophysical properties so that solid breeder designers may have reliable temperature control of the pebble bed over the duration of the use of the breeder in the reactor. 

In the rest of this chapter we will present in more detail the background of solid breeder research and the path we will take to solve some of the design issues of temperature control in solid breeders. We begin in \cref{sec:intro-blanket-description} by setting the foundation of the research with a discussion of the major design requirements and features of a fusion reactor blanket so that it may guide the choices and constraints of research efforts. In \cref{sec:intro-bed-integrity}, we will go into more of the physics and engineering behind the need for- and approaches for maintaining- temperature control in a solid breeder. Finally in \cref{sec:intro-scope-of-work}, the scope of this work will be outlined.
