The thermomechanical loads on solid breeders can hinder breeders' function in producing and releasing enough amount of tritium fuel for a DT fusion power plant. The thermomechanical loads on solid breeders, etc etc etc. For a fusion power plant to produce electricity and be self-sustaining in terms of its limiting fuel. [Blanket designs of solid breeders to meet this feasibility have evolved significantly...] The feasibility depends on the the ability engineer a device that surrounds the fusion reaction, captures the ejected neutron to breed tritium, allows recovery of that tritium to attain self-sufficiency, and delivers the energy deposited in the blanket as high quality heat into a power cycle to create electricity. Blanket designs of solid breeders have evolved significantly since their introduction in the 1970s. Some features of current breeder designs will be discussed next.

In this chapter we will present some of the basics of thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen and the need to artificially breed tritium.  Then we do some of the functions of a solid breeder / the role a solid breeder plays in the fusion power plant. Then introduce the solid breeder as a concept for the blanket. In \cref{sec:intro-bed-integrity}, we will go into more of the physics and engineering behind the need for- and approaches for maintaining- temperature control in a solid breeder. Finally in \cref{sec:intro-scope-of-work}, the scope of this work will be outlined.

In Part II (\cref{sec:hertz-theory,sec:modeling-heat-transfer,sec:modeling-pressure-drop}) we survey the state of the art in analysis of ceramic pebble beds, contact mechanics, and modeling thermal and mechanical interactions of packed beds.  In Part III (\cref{sec:modeling-dem,sec:modeling-cfd-dem,sec:modeling-lbm}) we outline the numerical methodology of the models and tools used in this study, namely: the discrete element method (DEM), coupled computational fluid dynamics and the discrete element method (CFD-DEM), and an integrated lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). We employ our physics knowledge and numerical tools to cover a range of studies in Part IV (\cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies,sec:dem-studies,sec:lbm-studies,sec:studies-experiments}). Finally, in Part V, we discuss the future of the current work and any limitations or interesting work that was beyond the scope of this dissertation.
