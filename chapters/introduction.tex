From the very beginning of fusion reactor studies, researchers recognized the necessity of generating tritium inside the thermonuclear reactor. In the attempt to force the fusion neutron to collide with a lithium atom and thus produce a tritium atom, a design approach was proposed by Abdou et al\cite{Abdou1974d} in 1975 wherein the plasma would be surrounded by a `blanket' of nonmobile, solid lithium. The lithium would be combined with ceramic materials to maintain the solid phase at elevated temperatures and exist in a packed bed (also referred to as pebble bed) form.

To date, lithiated ceramic pebbles have been chosen by many participants in ITER experiments as a material to be used for tritium generation\cite{Lulewicz2002, Mandal2012a, Tsuchiya1998, Cho2012}. The advantages of the pebble bed design include ease of assembling the solid into complex geometries, ease of tritium extraction from the porous bed via an interstitial purge of helium, and with the small size of pebbles being more resilient to thermal stresses than a solid brick of lithiated ceramic. Naturally, however, the pebble bed form carries with it many of its own disadvantages that must be understood and overcome.

In thermonuclear fusion reactors, the ceramic pebble beds will be contained and cooled by a structural material (currently it is foreseen to use ferritic or austenitic steel). As nuclear energy is deposited into the poorly conductive ceramic breeder the temperature rises well above the containment structure and subsequently attempts to swell from thermal expansion but is confined due to the structure. This simple action is the root of many design issues for the pebble bed. For one, the confined expansion directly leads to cracking of individual pebbles from the high contact stresses. The packing structure response depends on the extent and modes of cracking and the thermophysical properties likewise change. Second, thermal ratcheting or thermally-induced bed creep can lead to evolutions in thermophysical properties even in the absence of cracked pebbles. Finally, as the thermophysical properties evolve, global or local bed temperatures change and ultimately the tritium release characteristics of the bed deviate from any prediction one may have had from the initial packing of the ceramic pebble bed. 

Alleviating any of the issues that may plague the ceramic breeder all boil down to requiring temperature control via an understanding and of the morphological changes of the ceramic packed beds and their interaction with the interstitial purge gas and structural container. In this work we introduce enhancements and new elements to build upon the understanding from ceramic breeder models of past research efforts. 

In this chapter we will introduce more detail on the fundamental features of a fusion reactor blanket design as it relates to a breeder blanket design. Following that will be a list of the research objectives of this study. In Part II (\cref{sec:hertz-theory,sec:modeling-heat-transfer,sec:modeling-pressure-drop}) we survey the state of the art in analysis of ceramic pebble beds, contact mechanics, and modeling thermal and mechanical interactions of packed beds.  In Part III (\cref{sec:modeling-dem,sec:modeling-cfd-dem,sec:modeling-lbm}) we outline the numerical methodology of the models and tools used in this study, namely: the discrete element method (DEM), coupled computational fluid dynamics and the discrete element method (CFD-DEM), and an integrated lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM). We employ our physics knowledge and numerical tools to cover a range of studies in Part IV (\cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies,sec:dem-studies,sec:lbm-studies,sec:analysis-experiment}). Finally, in Part V, we discuss the future of the current work and any limitations or interesting work that was beyond the scope of this dissertation.
