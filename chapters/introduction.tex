The controlled, sustained thermonuclear fusion of light elements is the ultimate energy source for humanity. Fusion is an energy source that is inexhaustible (on our planetary scales), produces none of the greenhouse gases that are altering the climate, and avoids many of the dangers of nuclear fission. But overcoming the engineering obstacles to tame the fusion reaction is the greatest technological challenge of our generation.

The solid breeder blanket is a pivotal piece of engineering technology upon which the success of a fusion power plant rests. From the inception of the solid breeder concept in 1975, designs have evolved significantly to meet the requirements of operation in the harsh fusion environment. The successful operation of a solid breeder will see the device capture ejected neutrons to generate tritium fuel, allow recovery of the bred tritium, act as shield to other sensitive equipment, and convert energy into extractable heat for electricity production.

The breeding blanket will experience high neutron flux and temperatures up to 900~\celsius, and continue operating despite the environment without being replaced or actively maintained. Its important that the solid breeder not simply survive the thermal and mechanical demands of the reactor environment but continue to release predictable and acceptable amounts of tritium. Increasingly reliable and accurate models are crucial in the design of operational solid breeder blanket technologies. In this dissertation, we advance the field of solid breeder modeling with the introduction of new techniques and tools.

In this chapter we will present more detail on the basics of thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen, the need to artificially breed tritium, and their relation to solid breeder blanket design. We then identify the overall design needs of a ceramic pebble bed functioning as solid breeder and, moreover, how the efforts of this dissertation fit into larger research efforts. The chapter concludes with laying out the objectives and scope of this dissertation.

\chapter{Dissertation Outline}
In Part II (\cref{sec:hertz-theory,sec:modeling-state,sec:survey-packed-beds}) we survey the state of the art in analysis of ceramic pebble beds, contact mechanics, and modeling thermal and mechanical interactions of particles in packed beds and fluids moving interstitially.  In Part III (\cref{sec:modeling-dem,sec:modeling-cfd-dem,sec:modeling-lbm,sec:studies-experiments,sec:studies-numerics}) we outline the numerical methodology and development of modeling tools we shall use in the study and analysis of pebble beds and their evolving morphology due to external loads. We compartmentalize the numerical tools into three parts, namely: the discrete element method (DEM), coupled computational fluid dynamics and the discrete element method (CFD-DEM), and a lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) we integrate with DEM. The tools are then used to cover a range of studies in Part IV (\cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies,sec:dem-studies,sec:lbm-studies,sec:applied-studies}). Finally, in Part V, we discuss the next steps to be take that are necessary but beyond the scope of this dissertation as well as other research avenues that have been opened by the tools introduced here.
