The thermomechanical loads on solid breeders, etc etc etc. For a fusion power plant to produce electricity and be self-sustaining in terms of its limiting fuel. The feasibility depends on the the ability engineer a device that surrounds the fusion reaction, captures the ejected neutron to breed tritium, allows recovery of that tritium to attain self-sufficiency, and delivers the energy deposited in the blanket as high quality heat into a power cycle to create electricity. Blanket designs of solid breeders have evolved significantly since their introduction in the 1970s. Some features of current breeder designs will be discussed next.

In this chapter we will present some of the basics of thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen and the need to artificially breed tritium.  Then we do some of the functions of a solid breeder / the role a solid breeder plays in the fusion power plant. Then introduce the solid breeder as a concept for the blanket. In \cref{sec:intro-bed-integrity}, we will go into more of the physics and engineering behind the need for- and approaches for maintaining- temperature control in a solid breeder. Finally in \cref{sec:intro-scope-of-work}, the scope of this work will be outlined.
