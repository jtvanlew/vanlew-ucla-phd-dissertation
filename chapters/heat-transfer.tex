\chapter{Packed Bed Heat Transfer} \label{ch:heat-transfer}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
[talk about how lacking the DEM result is without the inclusion of helium in analysis. There are some Fusion papers on conductivity in vacuum and with helium]

We now consider the influence of helium on thermal transport of deposited nuclear energy as it is carried away by the cooled structural walls. We begin by considering the fluid in a continuum sense and the pebbles in a discrete one. The interactions of the fluid and solid are characterized by effective relationships in each discretized cell of fluid. We then consider an mesoscopic approach to the fluid-solid interaction with the Lattice-Boltzmann method. 

The chapter begins with introduction of the coupled fluid dynamics - discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approach: governing equations, discretization techniques, and algorithms.

We then do LBM. And stuff.
