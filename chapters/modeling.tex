This chapter presents the motivations and background of this study. First, it discusses energy usage in our society and the inevitable production of waste mechanical and thermal energies and their ubiquitous nature. This is followed by a brief discussion of common methods of converting ambient mechanical energy and waste heat into useful electrical energy. This chapter concludes with the objectives of this study and the scope of the document.

\section{Summary of DEM Modeling Background}

DEM formulation of pebble bed allows interrogation of the micromechanical interactions that lead to macroscopic, effective properties measurable in the lab
A modified Young’s modulus (fit to a probabilistic distribution) is necessary to capture the observed behavior of ceramic pebbles
Introduced into DEM simulations with a numeric random generator satisfying a Fisher-Snedecor distribution fit to the experimental data of the pebble batch
A crush prediction algorithm was developed and implemented into DEM
Numeric random generator satisfying a Weibull distribution assigns a strength value to each pebble which is constantly compared to all the contact forces on the pebble
A volume-conserving pebble fragmentation script is used to simulate a broken pebble
Based on current single radius implementation, modeling particle fragments should be approximately held to 
Investigating mixed-radius fragmentation – create a library of radius distributions that the software can draw from


Heat transfer (conduction) between pebbles may need a roughness parameter to reflect thermal transport between ceramic pebbles in a breeding blanket

DEM, alone, neglects the thermal transport between pebbles and interstitial gas
Theoretically- and experimentally-based  correlations have been proposed to include stagnant gas heat transfer in DEM framework
We must address the helium influence on heat transfer within the pebble bed – two schemes are developed here

\section{Dynamic Coupling of Fluid-particle, Volume-averaged Modeling} \label{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
[talk about how lacking the DEM result is without the inclusion of helium in analysis. There are some Fusion papers on conductivity in vacuum and with helium]

We now consider the influence of helium on thermal transport of deposited nuclear energy as it is carried away by the cooled structural walls. We begin by considering the fluid in a continuum sense and the pebbles in a discrete one. The interactions of the fluid and solid are characterized by effective relationships in each discretized cell of fluid. We then consider an mesoscopic approach to the fluid-solid interaction with the Lattice-Boltzmann method. 

The chapter begins with introduction of the coupled fluid dynamics - discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approasec: governing equations, discretization techniques, and algorithms.

We then do LBM. And stuff.
\section{Numerical Methodology}
% From TOFE 2014
Researchers of ceramic pebble beds for fusion reactors are concerned with damage to individual pebbles in the solid breeder volume; the accumulation of damage (\textit{e.g.} sintering, crushing) to many pebbles will ultimately have global effects on the tritium performance of the pebble bed volume.  The discrete element method provides us with the ability to probe particle-scale interactions so that we might understand, predict, and more importantly, avoid pebble damage and the morphological changes to the pebble bed associated with it. However, simulations with the DEM alone are only telling half of the story of the solid breeder. DEM models (as we are implementing them) are not able to capture the effects, neither on momentum nor energy, of an interstitial fluid. Therefore we present a modeling technique to supplement the DEM computations with a volume-averaged thermofluid model of helium (we will frequently refer to the thermofluid model as the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method). The technique of coupling CFD to DEM was first proposed by Tsuji\etal.\cite{Tsuji1992} in 1992. Since that time, the CFD-DEM coupling approach has grown as a tool for granular flow research. A comparison of model formulation for CFD-DEM is discussed clearly by Zhou\etal\cite{Zhou2010}.

\section{Static Coupling of Fluid-particle, Complete Modeling}\label{sec:modeling-lbm}
The volume-averaged approach of the CFD-DEM coupling is an effective and efficient method for solving transiently coupled helium flow and pebble interaction. However, there are cases when a complete knowledge of the tortuous flow of the interstitial helium is desired. But because the CFD-DEM solver does not resolve the pathways on the particle scale, knowledge of precise helium flow is not possible with that technique. Therefore we have also investigated a combination of DEM and with lattice-Boltzmann solvers. 

The lattice-Boltzmann approach to fluid simulations is a growing field of numerical modeling with a rich historical development. As the LBM approach is relatively unfamiliar, we will go through some of the notable evolutions of the modeling history and the background physics leading to the governing equations to be implemented numerically. Certainly this short study cannot do justice to a proper explanation of the underlying physics. References~\cite{Chen1998a,Viggen2009,Sukop2007,Chopard2002,succi2001lattice} should be read by those curious for excellent and thorough descriptions of the physics, modeling approaches, and applications of LBM theory to fluid dynamics problems.

In the rest of this chapter we introduce the core concepts behind the lattice-Boltzmann method, their application into numerical code, and finally a discussion of the solver used in this research.
