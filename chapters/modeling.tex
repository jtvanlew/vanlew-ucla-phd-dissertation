\chapter{Development of Modeling Tools for Ceramic Solid Breeders}\label{ch:modeling-development}

In this chapter we walk through the development of all the numerical tools to be used for the analysis of pebble damage in ceramic pebble beds for fusion reactors. The most important tool in the arsenal will be the pebble-scale modeling empowered by the discrete element method (DEM). The DEM code is the backbone upon which we will build two different methods of coupling to the helium purge gas; both dynamically and statically.

The core of the modeling code we employ in this dissertation come from open-sourced, crowd-supported, standard libraries. Along the process of developing the tools and adapting them to the specific needs of the ceramic breeders, I will introduce several new models and algorithms. The enhancements to the code represent a significant contribution to the design tools that will be available to solid breeder designers upon the successful completion of this dissertation.

\section{Particle-scale Modeling} \label{sec:modeling-dem}

The observable, macroscopic behavior of particulate, or granular, systems is a complex function of a multitude of particle interactions. Historically, empirical relationships have been used to describe these systems as if a continuous media (see the review of \cref{sec:modeling-state}). But with the advent of the discrete element method by Cundall and Strack and the acceleration of computing power, it became practical to investigate these particulate systems at the particle scale.\cite{Cundall1979} With the discrete element method, we track all the particles in the system in a Lagrangian manner. In the ensemble, the kinematics of each particle is tracked and updated based on balances (or imbalances) of forces or energy acting upon the particle. In this section I will lie out the formulas governing interaction of particles in the DEM framework, the methods of computation, and the code used for implementation.

\section{Summary of DEM Modeling Development}
[this is incomplete!!]
The DEM formulation of a pebble bed allows interrogation of the micromechanical interactions that lead to macroscopic, effective properties measurable in the lab. A modified Young's modulus (fit to a probabilistic distribution) is shown to be necessary to capture the observed behavior of ceramic pebbles. The modified Young's Modulus is realized in DEM simulations with a numeric random generator satisfying a Fisher-Snedecor distribution fit to the experimental data of the pebble batch. A crush prediction algorithm was developed and implemented into DEM with a numeric random generator satisfying a Weibull distribution which assigns a critical bed-force value to each pebble. The value is constantly compared to all the contact forces acting upon a pebble in the ensemble to check for crush events. In the case of a crushed pebble, a volume-conserving pebble fragmentation script is used to simulate a broken pebble.

DEM, alone, neglects the thermal transport between pebbles and interstitial gas. Theoretically- and experimentally-based  correlations have been proposed to include stagnant gas heat transfer in DEM framework. We must address the helium influence on heat transfer within the pebble bed Ð two schemes are developed here

\section{Dynamic Coupling of Fluid-particle, Volume-averaged Modeling} \label{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}

As we saw in Fig.~\ref{fig:keff-pressure}, even when stagnant in a bed of ceramic pebbles, helium plays a large role in the overall energy transport. A more comprehensive model of the thermophysics of a packed bed would therefore be sorely incomplete without including the contribution of helium. The first modeling approach adopted treats the helium as a volume-averaged thermofluid. Note, for shorthand I will frequently refer to the volume-averaged approach simply as the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method, this will be sufficient to distinguish the approach from the second one introduced later. This will be the first of two approaches taken to consider the influence of helium's flow on thermal transport through the packed bed. In this approach, the fluid is considered in an Eulerian, continuum sense and the pebbles remain in the discrete, Lagrangian realm. The interactions of the fluid and solid are characterized by effective relationships in each discretized cell of fluid. The technique of coupling CFD to DEM was first proposed by Tsuji\etal.\cite{Tsuji1992} in 1992. Since that time, the CFD-DEM coupling approach has grown as a tool for granular flow research. A comparison of model formulation for CFD-DEM is discussed extensively by Zhou\etal\cite{Zhou2010}.

\section{Summary of CFD-DEM Modeling Development}

Researchers of ceramic pebble beds for fusion reactors are concerned with damage to individual pebbles in the solid breeder volume; the accumulation of damage (\textit{e.g.} sintering, crushing) to many pebbles will ultimately have global effects on the tritium performance of the pebble bed volume.  The discrete element method provides us with the ability to probe particle-scale interactions so that we might understand, predict, and more importantly, avoid pebble damage and the morphological changes to the pebble bed associated with it. However, simulations with the DEM alone are only telling half of the story of the solid breeder. DEM models (as we are implementing them) are not able to capture the effects, neither on momentum nor energy, of an interstitial fluid.

\section{Static Coupling of Fluid-particle, Complete Modeling}\label{sec:modeling-lbm}
The volume-averaged approach of the CFD-DEM coupling is an effective and efficient method for solving transiently-coupled helium flow and pebble interaction via volume-averaging techniques for the fluid. However, there are situations when a complete knowledge of the tortuous flow of the interstitial helium is desired. Because the CFD-DEM solver does not resolve the pathways on the particle scale, knowledge of precise helium flow is not possible with that scheme. Therefore I have also investigated a method of linking our DEM pebble beds with lattice-Boltzmann solvers. 

The lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) to fluid simulations is a growing field of numerical modeling with a rich historical development. As the LBM approach is relatively new and its governing equations seem much more esoteric than the familiar conservation equations from continuum modeling, I will first go through some of the notable evolutions of the modeling history and the background physics leading to the governing equations -- which lend themselves to relatively straightforward numerical implementation. Certainly this short study cannot do justice to a proper explanation of the underlying physics. References~\cite{Chen1998a,Viggen2009,Sukop2007,Chopard2002,succi2001lattice} should be read by those curious for an excellent and thorough description of the physics, modeling approaches, and applications of LBM theory to fluid dynamics problems.

\section{Summary of LBM Modeling Development}

While concurrently developing the dynamic-coupling tools for the CFD-DEM models, I recognized the potential need for modeling the meandering path of low-$\Re$ flow of helium in our packed bed with heat generation. The sacrifice we make to achieve the numerical fidelity is that in this implementation of fluid-particle interaction we have a static coupling. The pebble-scale micromechanical interaction information for pebble damage modeling is still solved transiently in the DEM computations. When the bed is settled, a snapshot of the structure is discretized and loaded into the LBM solver which then calculates temperature and velocity fields of both solid and fluid phases. There is no cross-communication in this technique as the packing structure is effectively frozen during the LBM calculations.

The LBM approach was chosen in place of finite element or finite volume methodology because of issues with discretization of meshes in a three dimensional packed bed with interstitial gas. There are techniques to handle packed beds with continuum fluid mechanics software, but the size of packed beds we are interested in make the FEM approach intractable.

Furthermore, the simple LBM formulation of enforcing no-slip conditions on complex geometry is trivially realized with bounce-back rules on distribution functions. The multi-relaxation-time lattices for momentum and energy offer complete modeling of complex geometry and conjugate heat transfer with far less computational overhead compared to FEM models.
