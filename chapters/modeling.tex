\chapter{Development of Discrete Element Method for Pebble Bed Solid Breeders}\label{ch:modeling-development}

In this chapter I walk through the physics governing granular interaction in our discrete element method model. I begin with the kinematics framework which simply states that physical granular interactions obey Newton's laws of motion -- which we integrate in time. Contact mechanics models dictate the normal and tangential forces of interacting grains that feed into the generic kinematic equations; the choice of contact model thus largely dictates the overall behavior of the granular material. I will then introduce the granular heat conductance model implemented in DEM which too is reliant upon the chosen contact model. The contact model we use is based on Hertz's solution for elastic bodies -- thus the Young's modulus of the grain is an important property for our models and I spend some time exposing a new phenomenological model for the ceramic pebble elasticities. Lastly, I take advantage of single-pebble experiments of crush loads to develop a predictive model for granular crushing as well as fragmentation modeling techniques in a numerical ensemble.

\section{Grain-scale Modeling} \label{sec:modeling-dem}

The observable, macroscopic behavior of particulate, or granular, systems is a complex function of myriad particle interactions. Historically, empirical relationships have been used to describe these systems as if continuous media, \textit{e.g.} the correlations for heat transfer discussed in \Cref{sec:granular-ht-correlations}. But with the advent of the discrete element method by Cundall \& Strack and the acceleration of computing power, it became practical to investigate these granular materials at the particle scale without continuum assumptions \cite{Cundall1979}. With DEM, we track all the particles in the system in a Lagrangian manner. In the ensemble, the kinematics of each particle is tracked and updated based on balances (or imbalances) of forces or energy acting upon the particle.

\subsection{Particle Dynamics}\label{sec:particle-dynamics}

The grains in our system are allowed translational and rotational degrees of freedom. In a packed bed, we can restrict our attention to local forces between particles; neglecting, say, non-contact forces such as, van der Waals, electrostatic, or for the time being any fluid interaction forces. Assuming we know the contact forces acting upon particle $i$, Newton's equations of motion are sufficient to describe the particle kinematics. For translation and rotational degrees of freedom, the equations are:,
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:newtons-second}
\begin{align}
	m_i  \ddt{\vec{r}_i}   & = m_i\vec{g} + \vec{f}_i \label{eq:newton-translational} \\
	I_i\dt{\vec{\omega}_i} & = \vec{T}_i \label{eq:newton-rotational}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $m_i$ is the particle mass, $\vec{r}_i$ its location in space, $\vec{g}$ is gravity, $I_i$ is the particle's moment of inertia, and $\vec{\omega}_i$ its angular velocity.

The net contact force, $\vec{f}_i$, represents the sum of the normal and tangential forces from the total number of contacts, $Z$, acting on this grain.
\begin{equation}
 	\vec{f}_i = \sum_{j=1}^{Z} \vec{f}_{n,ij} + \vec{f}_{t,ij}
 \end{equation} 
and the net torque, $\vec{T}_i$, is similarly,
\begin{equation}
	\vec{T}_i = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{Z} \vec{r}_{ij} \times \vec{f}_{t,ij}
\end{equation}

When Cundall \& Strack first proposed the discrete element method, they used a linear spring-dashpot structure which saw normal and tangential forces written as,
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:dem-forces}
\begin{align}
	\vec{f}_{n,ij} &= k_{n,ij} \delta_{n,ij}\vec{n}_{ij} - \gamma_{n,ij} \vec{u}_{n,ij} 	\label{eq:normal-force} \\
	\vec{f}_{t,ij} &= k_{t,ij} \delta_{t,ij}\vec{t}_{ij} - \gamma_{t,ij} \vec{u}_{t,ij} 	\label{eq:tangential-force}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where Cundall \& Strack defined the stiffness coefficients $k$ as constants and local damping coefficients $\gamma$ were proportional to them, $\gamma \propto k$, to allow dissipation of energy and the system to reach an equilibrium. 

Relative normal and tangential velocities, respectively, are decomposed from particle velocities,
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:dem-velocities}
\begin{align}
	\vec{u}_{n,ij} &= (-(\vec{u}_i-\vec{u}_j)\cdot\vec{n}_{ij})\vec{n}_{ij} \\
	\vec{u}_{t,ij} &= (-(\vec{u}_i-\vec{u}_j)\cdot\vec{t}_{ij})\vec{t}_{ij}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with the unit vector $\vec{n}_{ij}$ pointing from particle $j$ to $i$

As in the solution of Hertzian interaction (see \Cref{sec:hertz-theory}), the surfaces of the two particles are allowed to virtually pass through each other (no deformation) resulting in normal and tangential overlaps of,
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:dem-overlaps}
\begin{align}
	\delta_{n,ij} &= (R_i + R_j) - (\vec{r}_i -\vec{r}_j)\cdot \vec{n}_{ij} \\
	\delta_{t,ij} &= \int_{t_{c,0}}^{t} \vec{u}_{t,ij}\,\mathrm{d}\tau 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where the fictive tangential overlap, $\delta_{t,ij}$, is truncated to so the tangential and normal forces obey Coulomb's Law, $\vec{f}_{t,ij} \le \mu_i \vec{f}_{n,ij}$ with $\mu$ as the coefficient of friction of the particle.

Thus the approach of DEM is relatively simple: calculate interaction forces between particles with \Cref{eq:dem-forces} based on the kinematics of velocity and position of interacting particles from \Cref{eq:dem-velocities} and \Cref{eq:dem-overlaps}, respectively, then update the positions based on the forces. As DEM evolved and drew attention of more researchers, more complex formulas governing the spring-dashpot coefficients of \Cref{eq:dem-forces} emerged. But the core approach remained the same and the models all fall into the same family of so-called `soft particle' models of DEM. A well-composed summary of the different DEM force models is given by Zhu\etal.\cite{Zhu2007}

The method used in this work fits into the computational skeleton of Cundall and Strack's method but with non-linear spring-dashpot coefficients defined by simplified Hertz-Mindlin-Deresiewicz model. In this model, the normal-direction stiffness coefficient of \Cref{eq:normal-force} is based on the Hertzian contact law (derived explicitly in \Cref{sec:hertz-theory}). The validity of Hertzian descriptions of normal forces is tested experimentally and reported in \Cref{sec:exp-reduction-factor}.The tangential-direction stiffness coefficient follows from Brilliantov \cite{Brilliantov1996, Zhu2007, Langston1995}. Together, the spring coefficients are,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	k_{n,ij} &= \frac{4}{3}E_{ij}^*\sqrt{R_{ij}^*\delta_{n,ij}} \\
	k_{t,ij} &= 8 G_{ij}^*\sqrt{R_{ij}^*\delta_{t,ij}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $E_{ij}^*$ is the pair Young's modulus, $G_{ij}^*$ is the pair bulk modulus, and $R_{ij}^*$ is the relative radius. The terms are defined as,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\frac{1}{E^*} &= \frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2} \\
	\frac{1}{R^*} &= \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} \\
	\frac{1}{G^*_{ij}} &= \frac{2(2+\nu_i)}{E_i} + \frac{2(2+\nu_j)}{E_j}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

Similar to Cundall \& Strack's formulation, damping coefficients, $\gamma$, are included to account for energy dissipated from the collision of two particles \cite{DiRenzo2004, Tsuji1992, Tsuji1993}. Whether the damping coefficient is local or global and the exact form of the coefficient is more important for loosely confined granular systems and dictates the way the system approaches an equilibrium state \cite{Makse2004}. For the case of our tightly packed pebble beds, it suffices to use the efficient form of Refs.\cite{Dippel1996, Makse2004, Brilliantov1996, Zhang2005, Zhu2007},
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\gamma_n &= \sqrt{5}\beta_\text{diss}\sqrt{m^*k_{n,ij}} \\
	\gamma_t &= \sqrt{\frac{10}{3}}\beta_\text{damp}\sqrt{k_{t,ij} m^*}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with $\beta_\text{damp}$ as the damping ratio, and the pair mass, $\frac{1}{m^*} = \frac{1}{m_i} + \frac{1}{m_j}$. For a stable system with $\beta_\text{damp} < 1$, the damping ratio is related to the coefficient of restitution, $e$, as
\begin{equation}
	\beta_\text{diss} = -\frac{\ln{e}}{\sqrt{\ln^2{e}+\pi^2}}
\end{equation}

Systems to be solved by DEM models are therefore well-defined after specifying the few material properties of $E$, $\nu$, $\rho$, and $R_p$ and the interaction properties of $\mu$ and $e$.

Having expressed the contact mechanics of the discrete element method, we now must integrate the kinematic equations of the particles to resolve their evolutions. The most common means of marching in time with DEM is the velocity-Verlet algorithm \cite{Kruggel-Emden2008}. In this algorithm, \Cref{eq:newtons-second} are integrated with half-steps in velocity, full steps in position, and then finally the full step in velocity. In practice, the two half-steps in velocity are often compressed into a single, full step. The computational time integration steps are given in explicit detail in \Cref{sec:dem-stability}. Owing to the explicit nature of the velocity-Verlet algorithm, stability is a constant concern with DEM simulations. Stable, critical time steps and practical means of circumventing unreasonably small time steps are discussed in \Cref{sec:dem-stability}.

A last note. Throughout this work, I required a fully quiesced bed to act as a starting point or demarcate a mechanically steady-state bed. To determine when this occurs, the total kinetic energy of the entire ensemble is monitored and a packed bed is considered to have completely settled once the magnitude of the system's kinetic energy is less than $10^{-8}$. A similar process was independently determined in a similar matter in the work of Ref.~\cite{Silbert2002}.

\subsection{Granular Heat Transfer in DEM}\label{sec:dem-heat-transfer}

In a way analogous to handling particle momentums with Newton's laws of motion, Lagrangian tracking of particle energy is obtained via the first law of thermodynamics. Each particle is treated as a single distinct object and thus internal temperature gradients are assumed negligible. The temperature of particle $i$ is governed by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thermoFirstLaw}
	m_iC_i\ddt{T_i} = Q_{s,i} + Q_{i}
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $C$ are the mass and the specific heat of the solid, respectively. Heat generation inside the particle is input with $Q_{s}$ and the total heat transferred to/from particle $i$ via conduction to all, $Z$, neighboring particles, is
\begin{equation}
	Q_i = \sum_{j=1}^Z Q_{ij}
\end{equation}

Assuming the particles are spherical, smooth, elastic, in vacuum, and we neglect radiation transfer between them, for two particles at temperatures $T_i$ and $T_j$, we quantify the amount of energy transferred between them with a contact conductance, $H_c$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:pebble-conduction-heat-transfer}
    Q_{ij} = H_{c}(T_i - T_j)
\end{equation}

Batchelor \& O'Brien\cite{Batchelor1977} developed a formulation of similar form and then made the brilliant observation that the temperature fields in the near-region of contacting spheres are analogous to the velocity potential of an incompressible, irrotational fluid passing from from one reservoir to another through a circular hole in a planar wall separating the two reservoirs. With the analogy, they could make use of the fluid flow solution to write the total heat flux across the circle of contact as \Cref{eq:pebble-conduction-heat-transfer} with heat conductance 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:batchelor-pebble-conductance}
    H_c = 2k_sa
\end{equation}
where $k_s$ is the conductivity of the contacting solids and $a$ is the radius of contact. Because we have assumed smooth, elastic, spherical solids, with Hertz theory (see \Cref{sec:hertz-theory}), contact radius can be found as a function of contact normal force, $F_n$,
\begin{equation}
    a =  \left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{R^*}{E^*}\right)^{1/3}F_n^{1/3} 
\end{equation}
where, as before, $\frac{1}{E^*} = \frac{1-\nu_1^2}{E_1} + \frac{1-\nu_2^2}{E_2}$ and $\frac{1}{R^*} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$. 

In the development of \Cref{eq:batchelor-pebble-conductance}, Batchelor \& O'Brien had assumed the two contacting spheres to be of equal conductivity, $k_s$. Cheng\etal\cite{Cheng19994199} proposed a slightly modified conductance which allows for contacting materials of different thermal conductivity. They give,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cheng-modification-batchelor}
    H_c = 2k^*a = 2k^* \left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{R^*}{E^*}\right)^{1/3}F_n^{1/3}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{1}{k^*} = \frac{1}{k_i} + \frac{1}{k_j}$. As well as being a more general, flexible formulation, the models analyzed by Cheng\etal\cite{Cheng19994199} are in good agreement with experiments.

Batchelor \& O'Brien developed \Cref{eq:batchelor-pebble-conductance} with the assumption of two contacting particles in vacuum but, once developed, showed\cite{Batchelor1977} that this form is still valid when immersed in a fluid providing that the thermal conductivity ratio, $\kappa = \frac{k_s}{k_f}$, of solid and fluid is well above unity. The condition is expressed as,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:conductance-validity-fluid}
    \frac{a}{R^*} \kappa \gg 1
\end{equation}
The term $\frac{a}{R^*}$, from \Cref{sec:hertz-theory}, is necessarily less than 1 for Hertz theory to be applicable. Thus for fluid in vacuum, the condition is identically satisfied but we must consider inaccuracies if we introduce an interstitial fluid with low conductivity ratios; for lithium ceramics in helium, the ratio is approximately $\kappa \approx 10$.

We step back from contact of a single pair of particles and consider a particle in an ensemble with many contacts. We must again consider the validity of applying \Cref{eq:cheng-modification-batchelor} at each contact. Vargas and McCarthy\cite{Vargas2002a}, propose introducing a conduction Biot number to relate resistance of heat transfer internal to a particle with resistance between particles,
\begin{equation}
    \Bi_c = \frac{H_c}{k^* d_p} = 2\frac{a}{d_p}
\end{equation}

Then if $\Bi_c \ll 1$, the individual energy transferred between each point of contact can be decoupled. The Biot number criteria is already satisfied for Hertz theory to be valid; having assumed that $\frac{a}{d_p} \ll 1$. Therefore the total heat transferred out of a single particle with $Z$ contacts, due to contact conductance, is the summed contribution of individual contacts, 
\begin{equation}
    Q_i = \sum_j^Z Q_{ij}
\end{equation}

For the case when we do \textit{not} have a perfectly smooth elastic sphere, we use the approach of Bahrami\etal, introducing a joint thermal resistance to develop a modified heat conductance term. Bahrami\etal\cite{Bahrami2004} use a joint thermal resistance of the superposition of macroscopic and microscopic influences; the thermal joint resistance is
\begin{equation}
	R_j = R_s + R_L
\end{equation}
where the subscript $L$ refers to macroscopic variables and $s$ refers to microscopic ones. Bahrami\etal~used the constriction formulation of Yovanovich\etal~to express the macroscopic resistance as\cite{Yovanovich1976}
\begin{equation}
	R_L = \frac{(1-a/R^*)^{3/2}}{2k^*a}
\end{equation}
If the contact of the two materials obeys Hertz contact law, then $a/R^* \ll 1$ and the above becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:macro-thermal-resistance}
	R_L = \frac{1}{2k^*a}
\end{equation}
which matches the heat conduction form of Batchelor \& O'Brien\cite{Batchelor1977}, \Cref{eq:batchelor-pebble-conductance}.

To determine the thermal resistance of the asperities in contact, Bahrami\etal~used a superposition of many cylindrical constrictions inside of the contact area. The result is given in \cite{Bahrami2004} as
\begin{equation}
	\psi_s^* = \begin{cases}
	\left(\frac{\pi H'R^{*2}}{F} \right)^s 										& F_c = 0\\
	(R^*/a)^2(H'/P_0)^s(1+s\gamma) 										& F \le F_c\\
	(H'/P_{0,c})^s(1+s\gamma_c)+\left[\frac{\pi H'R^{*2}}{(F-F_c)}\right]^s				& F\ge F_c
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\psi_s^*$ is a non-dimensional form of the surface roughness thermal resistance, defined as $\psi_s^* = 1.25\pi R^{*2}k^*(m/\sigma)\psi_s$, $k^*$ is the harmonic mean of contact grains thermal conductivity, $H'$ is the Vicker's hardness value, $F$ is the contact force, $P_0$ is the maximum pressure of contact, $s$ is a parameter based on the hardness constants, $\gamma = 1.5(P_0/P_{0,H})(a/a_H)^2-1$, $F_c$ is the critical force where $a = R^*$, $\gamma_c$ is the value of $\gamma$ at the critical force, $m$ is the mean absolute surface slope, and $\sigma$ is the root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness. For Hertzian contact, $\gamma = 0.5$.

Antonetti\etal~ proposed a correlation for mean absolute surface slope related to surface asperities as\cite{Antonetti1984}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:m-of-sigma}
	m = 0.125(\sigma\times10^6)^{0.402}
\end{equation}
where the range of applicability of surface roughness is \SI{0.216E-6}{\meter}$\le \sigma <$ \SI{9.6E-6}{\meter}. Thus the term $\sigma/m = 0.031\sigma^{0.598}$

For Hertzian contacts of the non-conforming ceramic materials, $F \ll F_c$, thus we consider only that case to write
\begin{equation}
	R_s = \frac{(R^*/a)^2(H'/P_0)^s(1+s/2)}{1.25\pi R^{*2}k^*(0.031\sigma^{0.598})}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}\label{eq:thermal-resistance-pressure}
	R_s = \frac{(H'/P_0)^s(1+s/2)}{1.25\pi a^2k^*\left(0.031\sigma^{0.598}\right)}
\end{equation}
For Hertzian contact, the maximum pressure is given by \Cref{eq:hertzian-pressure}. It is
\begin{equation*}
	P_0 = \frac{2E^*\delta_n}{\pi a}
\end{equation*}
Furthermore, as noted by Bahrami\etal, the parameter $s$ is in the range of $0.95\le s\le 0.97$. Therefore it is be approximated as $s=0.96$ here. The thermal resistance of \Cref{eq:thermal-resistance-pressure} is rewritten in a simplified form,
% \begin{equation}
% 	R_s = \frac{\pi^{s-1}}{1.25(2^s)}\left(\frac{H'}{E^*}\right)^s\frac{1+s/2}{k^*\delta_n^s}\left(\frac{\sigma}{m}\right)a^{s-2}
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:micro-thermal-resistance}
	R_s = \left(\frac{H'}{E^*\delta_n}\right)^{0.96}\left(\frac{\sigma}{m}\right)\frac{1}{1.720k^*a^{1.04}}
\end{equation}

The macroscopic and microscopic thermal resistances given in \Cref{eq:macro-thermal-resistance} and \Cref{eq:micro-thermal-resistance}, respectively, are combined to give the total joint thermal resistance of
\begin{equation}
	R_j = \left(\frac{H'}{E^*\delta_n}\right)^{0.96}\frac{0.031\sigma^{0.598}}{1.720k^*a^{1.04}} + \frac{1}{2k^*a}
\end{equation}
and the total thermal conductance between the two grains, $H_j = 1/R_J$, is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:micro-macro-conductance}
	H_j = \left[\left(\frac{H'}{E^*\delta_n}\right)^{0.96}\frac{0.031\sigma^{0.598}}{1.720k^*a^{1.04}} + \frac{1}{2k^*a}\right]^{-1}
\end{equation}

In the limit of zero roughness, the first term inside the bracket tends to 0 and the conductance is simply the Batchelor \& O'Brien form with Hertzian assumptions of perfectly smooth elastic spheres. In our DEM model, we employ a flag to choose between the simple smooth assumption for heat conductance, \Cref{eq:batchelor-pebble-conductance}, or the more advanced conductance equation, \Cref{eq:micro-macro-conductance}, if we have known hardness and roughness properties for ceramics.

%In the LIGGGHTS source code file `fix\_heat\_gran\_conduction.cpp', the macroscopic thermal resistance is incorporated into the heat conductance term. To include the microscopic term, we simply need information on the $H'$, $\sigma$, and $m$. All other terms of \Cref{eq:micro-macro-conductance} are available to the code.




\subsubsection{Thermal Expansion}
The stresses which will act upon the solid breeder volume during operation of the fusion reactor arise from the differential rate of thermal expansion from the highly heated ceramic volume and the relatively cool structural container. Moreover, thermal settling motion is observed in pebble beds with cyclic heating \cite{Tanigawa:2010cr, Vargas2007, Chen2009, Divoux2008}. Both of those phenomena originate from effects of thermal expansion of individual grains in the ensemble. Therefore, I introduce a simple thermal expansion method into the DEM structure that updates the diameter of each particle as,
\begin{equation}
	d_{p,i} = d_{p_0,i}\left[1+\beta_i\left(T_i - T_0\right)\right]
\end{equation}
where $\beta_i$ is the thermal expansion coefficient (in units of \SI{1}{\per\kelvin}), $T_i$ is the temperature of the pebble at the current step, and $d_{0,i}$ is the initial diameter of the pebble at temperature $T_0$. The update of pebble diameter based on thermal expansion could be computed at every time step as it is not computationally expensive. All the same, I have left flexibility in the code to allow the computation at an arbitrary interval of time, typically every $\frac{N}{\Delta t} = \frac{10^4}{10^{-7}}$ in most models of ceramic pebble beds).

\subsection{Numerical Implementation of DEM}\label{sec:dem-solver}

The primary computational tool used in this study is LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator) \cite{Plimpton1995}, a classical molecular dynamics code. The package of code, maintained by Sandia National Labs (http://lammps.sandia.gov), has many features making it particularly attractive for our use of granular material simulations. LAMMPS is open-source and written in highly-portable C++ allowing customization of any core modeling feature. LAMMPS runs with distributed-memory message-passing parallelism (MPI) and provides simple control (manual or automatic) of the spatial-decomposition of simulation domains for parallelizing. Perhaps most importantly, LAMMPS provides an efficient method for detecting and calculating pair-wise interaction forces; the largest consumer of run-time in the DEM algorithm \cite{Plimpton1995}. We build the LAMMPS core as a library to allow coupling LAMMPS features to other numerical tools. I use the scripting language of Python (Python 2.7) to write parent routines that pass information between LAMMPS objects while accessing all of Python's numeric and scientific libraries (\textit{e.g.} NumPy and SciPy). 

LAMMPS by default provides a rudimentary method of modeling of granular particles (the term `granular' in LAMMPS vernacular simply differentiates the discrete element of molecules or atoms from larger-scale granular particles of powders or pebbles); LAMMPS has been used for studying granular material since at least 2001 when Silbert\etal~studied granular flow on inclined planes \cite{Silbert2001}. However, the usefulness of LAMMPS for studying granular systems was greatly enhanced by LIGGGHTS (LAMMPS Improved for General Granular and Granular Heat Transfer Simulations), a suite of modules included on top of LAMMPS. LIGGGHTS has many academic and industrial contributors from around the world, with the code maintained as open-source by DCS Computing, GmbH.

Briefly, some notable features that LIGGGHTS brings to the LAMMPS environment include: built-in Hertz/Hooke pair styles with shear history, mesh importing for handling wall geometry, moving meshes, stress analysis of imported meshes, a macroscopic cohesion model, a heat transfer model, and improved dynamic load balancing of particles on processors\cite{Kloss2011,Kloss2012}. Both LIGGGHTS and LAMMPS are distributed under the open-source codes under terms of the Gnu General Public License.\cite{FreeSoftwareFoundationInc.2007} LIGGGHTS is compiled with modified source files of heat transfer to account for the introduction surface roughness given in \Cref{eq:micro-macro-conductance}.

\section{Young's Modulus Implementation in DEM for Ceramic Pebbles}\label{sec:exp-reduction-factor}
The discrete element method has been used by many ceramic breeder researchers to model the interaction of individual pebbles in an ensemble.\cite{An20071393, Lu2000, Zhao2010, Gan:2010uq, Annabattula2012a, VanLew2014} In the past studies, the Young's modulus of the ceramic materials used in DEM simulations was taken from historical data, for instance lithium metatitanate from Ref.~\cite{Gierszewski1998}. Furthermore, the assumption of Hertzian descriptions of normal contact for the pebbles is also assumed to be true without direct validation. In this section I will test the validity of Hertzian contact for describing pebble interaction and propose a modification of the Young's modulus to be used in DEM simulations. 

In our experimental test stand for crushing individual pebbles, shown in \Cref{fig:nfri-fmax}, our equipment was able to record accurate measurements of the force-travel relationship for each pebble, providing us with an opportunity to study the validity of the Hertzian contact laws. 

\begin{figure}[!h]

        \begin{subfigure}[b]{\doubleimagewidth}

        \end{subfigure}
        \caption{Crush forces of \lit~pebbles display probability distributions around mean values for each average diameter batch.}\label{fig:nfri-fmax}
\end{figure}

The derivation of the Hertz force can be found on page~\pageref{eq:hertz-normal-force}. The result is given again here for reference:
\begin{equation*}
  F_{n,ij} = \frac{4}{3}E_{ij}^* \sqrt{R_{ij}^*} \, \delta_{n,ij}^{3/2}
\end{equation*}
and, again, the pair Young's modulus and radius are
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{E^*} & = \frac{1-\nu_i^2}{E_i} + \frac{1-\nu_j^2}{E_j} \\
\frac{1}{R^*} & = \frac{1}{R_i} + \frac{1}{R_j}
\end{align*}

In experiments where we press a ceramic pebble between two anvils, we measure the travel, $s$, of the crosshead rather than the pebble overlap. We modify \Cref{eq:hertz-normal-force} to be represented in terms of travel ($s = 2\delta$). Furthermore, for a pebble ($R_i = R_p$) in contact with a smooth plane ($R_j \rightarrow \infty$), the relative radius is simply $R^* = R_p = d_p/2$. We write the Young's modulus of the pebble as $E_p$ and for the test stand's anvil as $E_s$; similarly for the Poisson ratios of the two materials. The Hertz force acting upon a pebble between anvils is then expressed as a function of the pebble and anvil properties as,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:contact-force}
        F = \left[\frac{1}{3}\frac{\sqrt{d_p}}{\frac{1-\nu_p^2}{E_p} + \frac{1-\nu_s^2}{E_s}}\right] s^{3/2}
\end{equation}

The Young's modulus and Poisson ratio of the test stand are known values that do not vary between pebble experiments. Similarly, in the application of Hertz theory, we also assume the Young's modulus and Poisson ratio of the ceramic are also known and constant. In that case, for any given pebble diameter, the term inside $[\quad]$ ought to be composed entirely of constants for any given pebble; there would therefore be a single force-travel response possible -- based only on $s$. Using material properties given in Ref.~\cite{Gierszewski1998} for \lit, we plot a set of parametric curves based on diameter over a range of travel. The properties we have used for the nickel-alloy anvil of our test stand and \lit~are given in \Cref{tab:hertz-dp-study-props}. The curves are given in \Cref{fig:hertz-dp-dependence}.

\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:hertz-dp-dependence} shows that, for a given pebble, that is strictly obeying Hertz theory, there is only a single force-displacement curve it can follow. However, during our experiments on \lit~pebbles, we observed behavior such as the curves shown in \Cref{fig:nfri-exp-curves}. The diameters of the pebbles are mapped to the colormap on the right side of the figures. These pebbles are responding much different than the expected Hertzian curve, predicted by \Cref{eq:contact-force}. 

We can confirm that the force-travel relationship goes as $F\propto s^{3/2}$ by plotting the force-travel data on log-log plots; the the slope of the data represents the power relationship of force and travel. The log-log plots are given in \Cref{fig:nfri-exp-curves-loglog}. The slope of the response is calculated for each experimental curve and a histogram is collected in \Cref{fig:nfri-loglog-slopes}. For both sets of \lit~pebbles, the data is heavily centered around a slope of $n=1.5$, validating the dependence of force on travel to be fitting Hertzian predictions.

We propose the experimental curves of force travel can be explained via unique reductions in Young's modulus of each pebble. We introduce an `apparent' Young's modulus for each pebble which is iteratively found as the Young's modulus which provides the best fit when used in \Cref{eq:contact-force} and compared to force-travel responses from experiments. The apparent Young's modulus is reported normalized against the \lit~Young's modulus from literature, $E_\text{lit}$, 
\begin{equation}
	\kappa = \frac{E_\text{peb}}{E_\text{lit}}
\end{equation}
where I will call $\kappa$ the softening coefficient. The sintered pebble value of Young's modulus for \lit~is taken from Ref.\cite{gnielinski1982berechnung} to be $E_\text{lit}= \si{124~GPa}$. Iterating over apparent Young's modulus, the L2-norm of the difference between Hertzian and experimental curves is used as the `error'. The L2 norm, $A$ for a given array, $a$ is 
\begin{equation}
	||A||_F = \left[\sum_{i,j}\textrm{abs}(a_{i,j})^2\right]^{1/2}
\end{equation}

This is a convenient way to compare the error at every point along the force-displacement curves. When the error is minimized, the apparent Young's modulus is recorded and a softening coefficient is calculated. A Hertzian curve (in black), using the apparent Young's modulus inserted in \Cref{eq:contact-forces}, is plotted alongside its respective experimental curve in \Cref{fig:nfri-exp-hertz}

The majority of the curves for two batches of \lit~pebbles analyzed (\Cref{fig:nfri-exp-hertz}) fit well to Hertzian curves with apparent Young's modulii. Apparent Young's modulii of the \lit~pebbles are given in \Cref{fig:nfri-E-plot}. Histograms of $\kappa$ for two batches of \lit~are given in \Cref{fig:nfri-kappa-hist}. The distributions for both batches of \lit~pebbles more closely resemble Snedecor's F distribution with many pebbles behaving with a very small $\kappa$, then a long tail of few pebbles with large $\kappa$.

\end{figure}

In \Cref{fig:nfri-kappa-dp-scatter} we see scatter plots of the pebble diameters against $\kappa$ values for the different batches of lithium ceramic pebbles. A Pearson Correlation value was calculated for each of the batches to quantify a correlation between diameter and $\kappa$. For the \lis~pebbles, we find $R = 0.198$ which is a weak positive correlation. For the \lit~pebbles we have $R = -0.385$ for $\bar{d}_p = 1$~mm and $R = -0.201$ for $\bar{d}_p = 1.5$~mm. Both of these are weakly negatively correlated. 

We hypothesize that manufacturing processes of pebbles leads to slightly different internal structures in the ceramic. Those differences yield stronger or weaker pebbles in a probability around a mean value, as seen in \Cref{fig:nfri-1-exp-fmax}. Different internal structure is likely also causing each pebble to behave with different stiffness. Thus if the Young's modulus in \Cref{eq:contact-force} for the batch of pebbles had a probability distribution, rather than a single value, we can account for the variations in responses of \Cref{fig:nfri-exp-curves}. 

The results of these single pebble experiments indicate that the Young's modulus traditionally used in DEM simulations for ceramic pebble beds in solid breeders is incorrect. Numerical recreations of the probability distribution curves will be used to apply $\kappa$ to pebbles in the ensemble. From the weak correlations between diameter and $\kappa$, we are free to ignore any diameter dependence when assigning $\kappa$ values in the DEM framework especially in light of the current implementation of monodisperse pebble beds. Therefore, numerically, when assigning Young's modulii to the particles in the ensemble, the $\kappa$ distribution will be applied in a random fashion.

\subsection{Comparison of Young's Modulii Used in DEM Simulations}\label{sec:dem-studies-youngs-modulus}

Proper calculation of normal force in DEM simulations is critical for accuracy in heat transfer modeling, as seen in \Cref{eq:cheng-modification-batchelor}, as well as accuracy in predictions of pebble crushing, as will be shown in \Cref{sec:failure-study}. We showed in the previous section that Hertzian contact is generally valid for describing pebble interactions. The Hertzian force is linearly proportional to the pair Young's modulus of contacting spheres. Based on the softening coefficient, $\kappa$, values found in \Cref{sec:exp-reduction-factor}, the apparent Young's modulii of \lis~and \lit~are, on average, less than half the values given for sintered materials in literature. For the case of \lit, the average value was closer to only 10\% of the value from literature. Thus the actual contact forces in pebble beds may be 10\% of the values found from DEM simulations with incorrect Young's modulus! In this section, I will compare a number of pebble beds analyzed with DEM using different Young's modulus. 

The first will involve simulations of uniaxial compression tests. One set of beds will be composed of pebbles with the single Young's modulus from literature and the other set will be composed of pebbles with a distribution of Young's modulii that fit the distribution from experiments. The second set of numerical experiments will simply compare the effective thermal conductivity of pebble beds as a function of Young's modulus.
%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


\subsubsection{Uniaxial Compression Simulations: Numerical Setup}
%In pebble bed breeder units, the stresses on the pebble regions are a result of thermal expansion of the relatively hot pebbles contained by relatively cool container walls. This process is a function of the coefficient of thermal expansion of the pebbles and their elevated temperature; the confined strain relates to a stress. 
The pebble beds are modeled as undergoing a standard uniaxial compression up to 6 MPa while measuring the macroscopic stress-strain for some parametrically varied pebble beds. At the moment of maximum stress, we can investigate the differences in contact forces of the different pebble beds.

Our pebble ensemble is composed of \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter} diameter \lis~pebbles. The pebble beds are initiated and packed in the same manner as \Cref{sec:dem-studies-effective-conductivity} (more details can be found in that section). There are two main bed groups. Set A: three beds (A.1-3) containing a single type of pebble with $E$ = \si{90 GPa}. Set B: four beds (B.1-4) containing ten types of pebbles with their Young's modulus assigned in a discrete, random way to satisfy the distribution seen from experimental data. For the DEM study, I fit the \lis~pebbles with a Weibull distribution of shape parameter $\sigma = 1.6$ where the average stiffness was $\bar{E} = 49$~GPa. The description of the two sets of pebble beds is visually represented in \Cref{fig:dem-types}. The pebble bed geometry was also the same used in the study of Ref.~\cite{VanLew2014}~: two virtual walls in the x-direction located at $x_\text{lim} = \pm 20 R_p$, periodic boundaries at the limits of $y_\text{lim} = \pm 15 R_p$, and a total of 8000 pebbles packed into the volume to an approximate height of $z_\text{lim} = 20 R_p$.

Among both sets, a parametric study was done on pebble radius and coefficient of friction. The radii of pebbles in beds A.1, A.2, B.1, and B.2 were constant at $R_p$=.25 mm. The radii of pebbles in beds A.3, B.3, and B.4 followed a Gaussian distribution about $\bar{R}_p$ = 0.25 mm: $\mu_d = R_p$ and $\sigma_d = R_p$. The coefficient of friction was set at $\mu = 0.2$ for beds A.1, A.3, B.1, and B.3; the coefficient of friction was $\mu = 0.3$ for beds A.2, B.2, and B.4.


\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\singleimagewidth]{figures/DEM-types}
  \caption{On the left, set A, a pebble bed with a single type, of $E = 120$ GPa. On the right, set B, is a pebble bed with 10, randomly distributed types; each type corresponds to a reduced, apparent Young's modulus as derived from experimental data.}\label{fig:dem-types}
\end{figure}



%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\subsubsection{Uniaxial Compression Simulations: Results}


A constant-velocity, uniaxial compression was applied to the pebble beds. A single cycle up to \SI{6}{\mega\pascal} then down to \SI{0}{\mega\pascal} was used on all the beds. The macroscopic measurements of stress-strain are shown for all the pebble beds in \Cref{fig:stress-strain}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\singleimagewidth]{figures/stress-strain}
  \caption{Stress-strain responses of pebble beds with: squares, constant Young's modulus; and circles, Gaussian distribution of Young's modulus. The constant Young's modulus beds all had much firmer responses for all parametric cases studied here.}\label{fig:stress-strain}
\end{figure}

Naturally, the pebble beds with smaller Young’s modulus (with circle markers) are more compliant to external loads. The result is true regardless of the coefficient of friction or distribution of pebble radius studied here. Group B moved to an average strain of about 2.6\% at \SI{6}{\mega\pascal}, by comparison the beds of Group A only had strained 1.9\% on average to reach the same stress. Among the beds of each group, pebble beds with constant radius pebbles behaved virtually the same as similar pebble beds with a Gaussian distribution on radius. An increase in the coefficient of friction had a moderate impact on the overall stress-strain response. 


The parametric study here shows that the largest contributor to stress-strain response is the Young’s modulus. The coefficient of friction and radius distribution had comparatively insignificant influence. A pebble bed geometry more directly comparable to oedometric compression experiments should be used to allow direct comparison and validation of the numerical models.


At the point of peak stress for each bed, I use DEM results to visualize the distribution of contact forces among all pebbles in the ensemble. A plot of the probability distributions of all the beds together, \Cref{fig:all-contact-forces}, shows that the majority of the contacts in all the beds are equally small. There are a few overall trends we observe from the results however. The pebble beds with the constant Young's modulus are always higher for their comparable version with distributed Young's modulus. For pebble beds with comparable Young's modulii and radii, higher coefficients of friction generally have higher peak contact forces. Pebble beds' radius distributions have much less impact on peak contact forces than either coefficient of friction or Young’s modulus. Another method of comparing overall contact force distributions is to consider predictions on pebble cracking which assigns a strength value at random to pebbles in the bed (details are given in \Cref{sec:exp-reduction-factor}). At the point of maximum stress, this is done and the results are shown in \Cref{tab:num-crush-percent}.

While overall the predicted number of broken pebbles is small, we compare similar parameteric pebble beds and in each case pebble beds with modified Young’s modulus overall predict smaller percentages of broken pebbles. Pebble crushing is a major topic for the overall evaluation of the feasibility of ceramic pebble beds in fusion reactors. This study reveals that past DEM work on pebble crushing, such as Ref.~\cite{Annabattula2012a,Annabattula2014,Zhao2013}, were likely over-predicting the extent of crushing if the Young's modulus used in the study was much larger than the realistic response of individual pebbles.

\subsection{Conclusions of Young's Modulus Study}
Variation in production techniques for ceramic pebbles have lead to batches of pebbles with slight differences in their ceramic microstructure, as evident in the wide distribution of crush loads reported in past studies, \textit{e.g.} Refs.~\cite{Zhao2012,Mandal2012a}. By the same token, the different microstructures should naturally lead to variation in Young’s modulus. However up to now values of Young’s modulus used in numerical models are taken from values measured for large sintered pellets of ceramic materials. Based on single pebble experiments and the application of Hertz theory, a technique for introducing a modified Young’s modulus into DEM models has been proposed here. DEM simulations show the impact of modified pebble elasticity on both macroscopic measurements of stress-strain curves as well as mesoscopic measures of inter-pebble contact force -- with major implications for prediction of pebble crushing in ceramic pebble beds and macroscopic $\sigma-\epsilon$ responses. The models applying the softening coefficient, $\kappa$, predict more compliant pebble beds and smaller peak contact forces in beds and thus fewer crushed pebbles.

Thus I conclude that in DEM numerical models for pebble damage, the modified Young's modulus with softening coefficients matching the probability density function from experiments must be used. In this way, we can expect a more realistic numerical tool to simulate pebble damage, bed rearrangement, and heat transfer.

\section{Pebble Damage Modeling}\label{sec:failure-study}
In modeling pebble damage, there are two main tasks: predicting when the grain crushes and what happens to the pebble during the crushing event. For the former, the task is to develop a model for predicting a pebble crushing event; \textit{i.e.} what external load (mechanical or thermal) will cause a pebble to crack, shatter, fracture, etc. To tackle the latter is to develop a model which simulates the damage of that pebble; \textit{i.e.} a scheme to treat a cracked, shattered, or crushed pebble in the assembly as small particles, removed particles, or particles with modified material properties. The following sections will discuss both of these main tasks. In the first, I review recent advances in modeling and predicting pebble crushing in ensembles. Based on the historical precedents, I will show how our observations of individual pebble crush experiments are useful to create a metric (strain energy) to link the data to the contact forces measured in DEM to help predict crushing of pebbles in the ensemble. Finally numerical modeling of fragmentation of pebbles is introduced -- and fragmentation schemes evaluated.

\subsection{Calculating Critical Strain Energy}
It is impractical, if not impossible, to experimentally measure accurate contact forces between all the pebbles in a densely-packed, three-dimensional ensemble. In investigating the probability of pebbles becoming damaged (\textit{i.e.} crushed or cracked) in a packed bed, we therefore rely on the combined information gained from indirect measurements of the entire pebble bed, crush experiments of individual pebbles, and the predictive capabilities of DEM simulations. With the rise of micro-mechanical tools and computing power, attempting to predict when ceramic pebbles will crush in an ensemble, based on inter-particle contact forces, has received considerable attention.\cite{Marketos2007,Pitchumani2004} Research on pebble damage has also been taken up by others in the fusion community to predict the onset of pebble crushing as a function of an external pressure and the resulting changes to mechanical properties such as the stress-strain of the pebble bed.\cite{Annabattula2012a, Zhao2012, Zhao2013}

Probability and statistics were applied to the study of packed beds of brittle grains by Marketos and Bolton\cite{Marketos2007}. The fundamental assumption in their predictive method was the independence of crushing events. They used their model to predict the initiation of crushing as well as the evolution of the packing after crushing. They created somewhat arbitrary probability distributions of the strength of their granular particles,
\begin{equation}
	h(\Phi) = \frac{0.0395}{\sqrt{\Phi}}
\end{equation}
where $\Phi$ is a characteristic strength parameter falling between 160 and 640~N. The form of their distribution was based on single crushing tests on quartz particles from Nakata\etal.

A common alternative distribution is to use a form first proposed by Weibull for a material under uniform stress\cite{Kwok2013,Zhao2011,nakata1999probabilistic,Zhao2013,Pitchumani2004}. The form, as written by Zhao\etal~is,
\begin{equation}
	P_s = 1 - \exp\left[-\left(\frac{W_c}{W_\text{mat}}\right)^m\right]
\end{equation}
where $W_c$ is the energy absorbed by the pebble and $W_\text{mat}$ and $m$ characterize the material. An important note is how to calculate the critical strain energy for the pebble. Refs.~\cite{Marketos2007} and \cite{Zhao2011} note the necessity to consider the coordination number dependence on total strain energy. In other words, the total strain energy is the cumulative total of strain energy at every contact. Zhao\etal~give the critical strain as
\begin{equation}
	W_c = \sum_{i=1}^{Z}\left(\frac{9}{80 R_{ij}^*}\right)^{1/3} \left(\frac{1}{E_{ij}^*}\right)^{2/3} F_{n,ij}^{5/3}
\end{equation}
where $Z$ is the coordination number of pebble $i$. 

However, Russell\etal, analyzed simple, ideal granular assemblies for which they could find analytical solutions to stress distributions inside of pebbles.\cite{Russell2009} In their work, failure of a granular particle initiates at the location of maximum stress invariant ratios. In the contact of elastic spheres, the stress fields near the contact areas are highly localized. Because of the highly localized effects, Russell\etal~find that in granular assemblies the contributions to failure initiation are not additive. They discovered that the initiation of failure is always located adjacent to the largest force irrespective of the material properties or geometric size of the pebbles in an ensemble. Russell\etal~conclude: \emph{the largest contact force acting upon a particle is the primary agent driving the damage of the individual}.\cite{Russell2009} Based upon the failure criterion developed for brittle materials, crushing of an individual does not directly depend upon the presence or magnitude of any lesser contact forces acting on the particle. Although their results were obtained for idealized assemblies, the results are generally true for any situation where multiple contact forces are present.

\end{figure}
Based on the compelling arguments of Russell\etal, I define a pebble in an ensemble to crush \emph{when a single contact force surpasses a defined critical value for that pebble}. The definition of the critical force is an empirical value derived from experiments on single pebbles. Because the normal force between two elastic objects is a function of the material properties of the interacting objects (see, \textit{e.g.}, \Cref{eq:hertz-normal-force}), we cannot directly compare the forces between the pebble and test stand with pebble-pebble contacts in an ensemble. An alternative is to integrate the force along displacement, resulting in strain energy of the contact. The strain energy can then relate the contact forces between different material interactions, in a similar manner to Refs\cite{Zhao2013,Annabattula2012a}.

We begin by integrating the Hertzian force along the overlap of contact to find the strain energy $W_\epsilon$, of contact between any two materials,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:strain-energy-integral}
	W_\epsilon = \int_0^{\delta_c}\!F_n(\delta')\,\mathrm{d}\delta'
\end{equation}
where the upper limit of the integration is the critical overlap $\delta_c$. Inserting the Hertzian relation of \Cref{eq:hertz-normal-force} into \Cref{eq:strain-energy-integral} gives,
\begin{align}
	W_\epsilon& = \int_0^{\delta_c}\!  \frac{4}{3}E^*\sqrt{R^*}\,\delta'^{3/2} \,\mathrm{d}\delta' \\
	%W_\epsilon & = \frac{4}{3}E^*\sqrt{R^*} \left[\frac{2}{5}\,{\delta_c}^{5/2}\right] \\
	W_\epsilon & = \frac{8}{15}E^*\sqrt{R^*}\, {\delta_c}^{5/2}
\end{align}

I will call the strain energy of the pebble compressed between platens as the lab strain energy, $W_{\epsilon,L}$. In pebble crushing experiments, we record the strain energy absorbed up to the point of crushing, the data for \lis~and \lit~pebbles are shown in \Cref{fig:fzk-w-hist} and~\Cref{fig:nfri-w-hist}, respectively. The strain energy of two particles in contact will be the bed strain energy, $W_{\epsilon,B}$. The assumption is made that, if each contact interaction computed in DEM simulations is integrated to the proper critical overlap, the strain energies will be equal at that contact. Thus lab strain energy is equated to bed strain energy to find the critical ensemble overlap value, $\delta_{c,B}$, in terms of experimental values,
\begin{equation}
	W_{\epsilon,L} = W_{\epsilon,B} = \frac{8}{15}E_B^*\sqrt{R_B^*}\, {\delta_{c,B}}^{5/2}
\end{equation}
the critical pebble bed overlap is therefore,
\begin{equation}
	\delta_{c,B} = \left[\frac{15W_{\epsilon,L}}{8E_B^*\sqrt{R_B^*}}\right]^{2/5}
\end{equation}

This overlap can be reinserted to the Hertz force of \Cref{eq:hertz-normal-force} to find the critical force (crush force) of the interacting particles in the numeric ensemble as a function of the critical strain energy of the lab. Doing this, we find,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:peb_hertz}
	F_{c,B} = C{E_B^*}^{2/5}{R_B^*}^{1/5}W_{\epsilon,L}^{3/5}
\end{equation}
where $C = \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{15}{8}\right)^{3/5}$.

\Cref{eq:peb_hertz} is a generic translation between lab materials and packed bed materials. We will use the equation as the basis for our pebble crushing prediction in DEM simulations. During the DEM run, we can find the maximum normal force acting on each pebble,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:find_fmax}
	F_{c} = \max F_{n,ij}
\end{equation}

        \caption{Fitting the strain energy with a Weibull distribution with shape parameter specific for the two batches of \lit~pebbles.}\label{fig:nfri-w-cdf}
\end{figure}

Then define a pebble crushing event as occurring when the pebble's maximum normal force is greater than the critical bed force defined in \Cref{eq:peb_hertz},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crush-predict}
  F_{c} > F_{c,B} = \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{15}{8}\right)^{3/5}{E_B^*}^{2/5}{R_B^*}^{1/5}W_{\epsilon,L}^{3/5}
\end{equation}

For implementation in DEM, the crush force prediction becomes probabilistic naturally due to the distribution of strain energies measured in experiments; therefore imparting a distribution shape to the $F_{c,B}$ prediction. Cumulative distribution functions are generated for the experimental strain energy data for which we fit Weibull distribution curves, of the form
\begin{equation}
	\Xi = \lambda\left[-\ln(W_\epsilon)\right]^{1/\sigma}
\end{equation}
where the shape parameter, $\sigma$, is fit to the specific curve of each set of experimental data and the second parameter, $\lambda$ is defined as
\[
\lambda = \bar{W}_\epsilon - \min W_\epsilon
\]
In \Cref{fig:fzk-w-cdf} and~\Cref{fig:nfri-w-cdf} we see the experimental data and the Weibull fits specific to the ceramic material and batch. The Weibull distribution functions are recreated numerically in the assignment of each pebbles `critical bed force' value. 

In this section we have developed a numerical basis for predicting pebble crushing in a ceramic pebble bed based on translations of strain energy distribution functions of experimental data. Implementation in DEM simulations requires defining an array of strain energies, the distribution of which must satisfy the Weibull distribution matching experimental data. The array of strain energies is loaded as a dictionary variable with the DEM pebble identification number as key and strain energy as value. Then we loop through all pebble IDs in the ensemble and check the criteria defined in \Cref{eq:crush-predict}. If a pebble's maximum force exceeds the crush criteria, the pebble is flagged for fragmentation. Similar to implementation of thermal expansion, it is possible at every time step to check for broken pebbles. However, the stress on pebbles is due to thermal expansion and is therefore nonsensical to check for broken pebbles more frequently than updating pebble diameters with thermal expansion; therefore the same timestep is used in both of these custom numerical routines.

When a pebble has been flagged as being crushed, it is quite another task to model the fragmentation. Many researchers have made attempts at implementing various tricks to attempt to capture the effects of pebbles crushing in an ensemble. In the next section I will review some of the past efforts as well as a new approach and some evaluation of the work.



\subsection{Modeling Fragments of a Crushed Pebble}\label{sec:fragmentation}
Modeling of `crushed pebbles' in numerical assemblies has been attempted by a number of researchers. In most cases, indirect changes to the simulation are done with the hope of matching macroscopic features of beds that are observable in assemblies with damaged pebbles. In work by Marketos and Bolton, they treated a crushed pebble very similar to Van Lew\etal; when a pebble was damaged it was removed completely from the assembly.\cite{Marketos2007,VanLew2014} Marketos and Bolton study the stress-strain response of a pebble bed with a predictive crushing routine while Van Lew\etal~studied the effective thermal conductivity of a damaged pebble bed.

Annabattula\etal, noting the computationally expensive approach of modeling small fragments, introduced damaged pebbles via reduction in elastic modulus.\cite{Annabattula2012a} Annabattula\etal~was also interested in the mechanics of the pebble bed with the presence of crushable materials. The study highlighted the differences in behavior of assemblies with different failure criteria and initial packings. From \Cref{fig:annabattula-stress-strain}, results are qualitatively similar to the stress-strain curves depicted by Marketos\etal.

\end{figure}


Ben-Nun\etal~studied the effects of fragmentation in two dimensional DEM studies of compressed packings.\cite{Ben-Nun2010,Ben-Nun2010a} In two dimensions, they were able to introduce small fragments after a crush event without excessive computational overhead. Under compression, they observed small fragments rearranging into smaller pores, giving rise to new force chains, until ultimately for a given initial volume an asymptotic limit is reached where fracture effectively stopped.\cite{Ben-Nun2010a} More important than his conclusions on self-organization in highly fragmented volumes were his observations that were similarly made here. In essence, any attempt to prescribe spherical fragments within the surface of a parent sphere will always fail to satisfy mass conservation (except in the limit of the fragment radius approaching 0). In order to resolve this situation Ben-Nun\etal~conserve the mass by inserting fragments in two phases: first, non-overlapping fragments are prescribed and randomly inserted, second, a rapid linear expansion is then introduced in the second phase to gain back the overall solid mass. Our approach, to be discussed soon, will be seen to be quite similar.

The importance of mass conservation in modeling ceramic pebbles beds for fusion is critically important to conserve energy in pre- and post-fragmentation systems. In the first study of Van Lew\etal~, where broken pebbles were removed from the system, energy input into two systems being studied were not dissimilar. This is quantified as follows. The total energy pouring into the non-damaged system is
\begin{equation}
	E_h = \frac{q'''_\text{nuc} V_\text{peb} N}{V_\text{bed}}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the total number of pebbles of volume $V_\text{peb}$ that exist in the pebble bed of volume $V_\text{bed}$. After a crushing event, when pebbles are removed, the total amount of energy is
\begin{equation}
	E_h' = \frac{q'''_\text{nuc} V_\text{peb} \eta N}{V_\text{bed}}
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the percent of crushed pebbles. Obviously then, the ratio of the two heating rates is\begin{equation}
	\frac{E_h'}{E_h} = 1 - \eta
\end{equation}
and the energy deposited is not balanced between a virgin bed and one with crushed pebbles.

To continue the discussion of mass conservation of spherical packings, we consider how many fragments of a given radius would need to be inserted to conserve mass. In terms of DEM spheres we strictly wish to conserve mass between a solid pebble of radius $R_p$ and the crushed fragments of radius $R_c$. Thus the number of crushed fragments (spheres) per crushed pebble is
\begin{equation}\label{eq:nc-crushed-fragments}
	N_c = \left(\frac{R_c}{R_p}\right)^{-3}
\end{equation}

The number of fragments goes like the inverse of radius ratio to the third power; the number of crushed fragments to represent a single crushed pebble increases rapidly as the fragments shrink. The relationship between radius ratio and number of fragment particles is given in \Cref{fig:fragment-count}. Note that in the DEM simulation, it is impossible to insert fractions of a particle so the number of fragment pebbles is rounded to the nearest integer in the table. While the large numbers of fragments are computationally expensive to model, they are not prohibitive at least down to $R_c/R_p = 0.20$, as will be seen later.

\begin{figure}[!t]

\end{figure}

% In typical DEM simulations that can run within reasonable amounts of time on the machines available for this dissertation, a reasonable number of particles is on the order of \num{10000}. Significantly more and the run times become impractical for study. To show how quickly the number of particle fragments can quickly get out of hand in a simulation with small $R_c/R_p$, if we begin with \num{6000} pebbles and only 2\% break, with a radius ratio of $R_c/R_p = 0.2$, the number of pebbles to be added would be \num{15000}. The new particle fragments (less the crushed particles) plus the original would require \num{21000} particles in the system. In our simulations, we often test the effects on effective thermal conductivity at particle crush amounts of to 10\%. For the pebble bed mentioned here, that would mean \num{81000} particles in the system and it would be computationally taxing. The result is that, for the sake of computational times, the larger crush fragment radii are desired, \textit{i.e.} $R_c/R_p > 0.3$.
Aside from satisfying conservation of mass, we must physically insert the particle fragments into void space in the simulation domain. During the course of the simulation, when we choose to replace the pebble with the fragments, the only available room is the spherical void left over by the damaged pebble. As mentioned previously, without allowing overlap, the condition of mass conservation will never be satisfied. Then we may consider what precisely is the smallest size sphere that could hold non-overlapped spheres of given fragment radii.

Luckily, dense packing of spheres inside a larger sphere is an interesting mathematical problem and has been tackled by many mathematicians in the past. \href{http://www.randomwalk.de/sphere/insphr/spisbest.txt}{Hugh Pfoertner} keeps a compiled list of many solutions for a number of particles; many solutions are his are from Gensane.\cite{gensane2003dense} If we consider, for instance, that a radius ratio of $R_c/R_p = 0.3$ requires 37 particle fragments, then we can also find from Ref.~\cite{gensane2003dense} that 37 particles would have to be of radius 0.2406866 to fit into a single sphere of radius of unity. We defined the particle fragment radius as $R_c$, the original particle as $R_p$, and then the radius of sphere necessary to hold the $N_c$ fragments will be $R_N$, we can find a relationship between the volume of sphere $V_p$ and necessary volume $V_N$,
\begin{equation}
	r_1^* = \frac{R_c}{R_p}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	r_2^* = \frac{R_c}{R_N}
\end{equation}
then 
\begin{equation}
	R_N = R_p \frac{r_1^*}{r_2^*}
\end{equation}
thus
\begin{equation}
	\frac{V_N}{V_p} = \left(\frac{r_1^*}{r_2^*}\right)^3
\end{equation}

Choosing a linearly spaced distribution of $r_1^*$ between 0 and 1, allows finding $N_c$ particles necessary to conserve mass. Then from the $N_c$ particles we can find from the database of sphere packing solutions the size of sphere that would be necessary to fit the $N_c$ particles. The calculations are carried out and shown in \Cref{fig:volume-ratio}. The data in Ref.~\cite{gensane2003dense} does not go above 72 spheres so we are limited to radius ratios above about $r_1^* > 0.24$.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=\singleimagewidth]{figures/crush-fragments/fragment-volume-ratio.png}
    \caption{The volume necessary to house the particles of different radius ratios decreases toward unity as the radius ratio decreases. It is greater than 5 times the volume for large $r_1^*$.}
    \label{fig:volume-ratio}
\end{figure}

The plot of \Cref{fig:volume-ratio} shows that for particle fragments of reasonable numbers ($N_c\approx 20$ for $r_1^*\approx 0.3$), the volume necessary to fit the number of volume-conserving particles is greater than double the volume of the original sphere! Therefore from the point of view of having the physical space to insert the fragments, smaller sized fragments are ideal. To insert the few number of large particles would require disrupting the packing in the region of the damaged particle. From this discussion, we conclude that an upper size limit should approximately be $r_1^* = 0.3$. This result agrees with the work from Ben-Nun\etal~who only studied configurations with particles as large as $r_1^*=1/3$.\cite{Ben-Nun2010a}

Our approach for inserting mass-conserving fragments is in essence similar to that described by Ben-Nun\etal. Whereas they would insert fragments fully enveloped in the circle and then increase their radius up to a mass-conserving value, we insert mass-conserving spheres but allow extreme overlap in the first phase. In the second phase, we permit a relaxation of the overlap by enforcing a limit to the travel during integration with the velocity-Verlet scheme. After the fragments have slowly moved away from each other and reached a local equilibrium with their neighboring particles, we re-initiate standard velocity-Verlet integration of all the particles in the ensemble to allow fragmentation resettling.

In the next section, we see some sample pebble beds where fragmentation is induced to equal amounts but with varying fragmentation sizes. We will investigate such characteristics as disruption caused by large fragments and travel of small fragments during resettling.

\subsubsection{Example Beds with Fragmentation}

To study the effects on a pebble bed of different fragmentation schemes, I begin with a bed of \num{6875} particles and randomly crush 1\%. This was done with a range of fragments of size $r_1^* = [0.20, 0.25, 0.35, 0.50]$. The number of particles inserted for these different $r_1^*$ followed the from \Cref{eq:nc-crushed-fragments}. In the images of \Cref{fig:crush-settling-pictures-1},~\Cref{fig:crush-settling-pictures-2},~\Cref{fig:crush-settling-pictures-3}, and~\Cref{fig:crush-settling-pictures-4}, we see the initial packing of new particle fragments (in blue) settle into the interstitial gaps of the packing structure of original pebbles (yellow).

\end{figure}

The settling of crushing fragments is also visualized in \Cref{fig:displacement-scatter}. For this figure, the magnitude of displacement for all the crushed fragments is recorded based on the change between initial insertion location and final resting place. The displacement of the fragments is normalized against a pebble diameter and then a probability distribution is generated. Immediately obvious from \Cref{fig:displacement-scatter} is that larger fragments, $r_1^*[0.35, 0.50]$ rarely travel beyond their original insertion point; very few particles have a normalized fragment settling distance larger than 1.0. In contrast, the smaller fragments have a good deal traveling well beyond a single pebble diameter. In fact, 12\% of the fragments of size $r_1^* = 0.20$ travel more than 2 diameters before coming to rest. We will return to the effects of pebble fragment travel when we consider ITER-relevant configurations and pebble bed heating.

    \label{fig:fragment-packing-fraction}
\end{figure}

From \Cref{fig:displacement-scatter}, the impression then arises that the large displacement magnitudes of the small crush fragments may result in an overall less-dense bed with large increase in packing fraction near the floor where pebbles settle. For 1\% crushed pebbles, there is some observable changes to the local packing fraction near the floor of the pebble bed, but no appreciable changes elsewhere in the bulk. In \Cref{fig:fragment-packing-fraction}, the packing fractions of the four different pebble beds are given. We look closely at the distribution within the first pebble diameter (see inset of \Cref{fig:fragment-packing-fraction}) and see the small crush fragments have a small change to the local packing fraction as they settled onto the floor of the container.

The last point to discuss is how the different size particles change the distribution of contact forces inside the ensemble. We plot the scatter of contact forces for all the pebbles in the ensemble in \Cref{fig:fragment-contact-forces}. We are most interested in the contact loads carried by the large particles that make up the force network after crush fragments are inserted into the ensemble. The small fragments, moving through the interstitial gaps, are not expected to carry much load. Therefore in the data processing for the subplot of \Cref{fig:fragment-contact-forces-20} and~\Cref{fig:fragment-contact-forces-25}, I did not include the vast number of small forces on the fragments in the average value of contact force. Opposingly, the larger fragments, $r_1^*>0.4$, are expected to be inserted firmly into the contact network and their contribution to the average value is included.

What we see in \Cref{fig:fragment-contact-forces} is that the average contact forces in the pebble bed remain mostly unchanged as a function of the size of the fragment radii. For all pebble beds, after the bed re-settles from the crushing event, the average contact forces (to the 1/3 power, which is the value important for heat transfer, see \Cref{sec:dem-studies-effective-conductivity}) are approximately $4.9\ N^{1/3}$. None of the beds have a maximum value greater than $9\ N^{1/3}$.

\subsection{Conclusions of Pebble Failure Modeling}

This section began with a review of past research efforts on predicting pebble crushing in an ensemble. There are two main theories for predicting pebble crushing: 1) the failure of a pebble is due to the summed total strain energy of all contacts acting on a pebble in an ensemble. 2) failure of a pebble is a localized event where the maximum contact force is the main agent for driving fragmentation. In our work, we have adopted the philosophy of the second approach. In short, I consider \textit{only the single largest contact force} on a pebble, irrespective of the number and magnitude of lesser contact forces on that pebble when predicting a crush event. With that in mind, we then showed how an equation can define critical contact forces for pebbles in a DEM simulation as defined by strain energy distributions measured from experimental campaigns on individual pebbles. The probabilistic nature of experimental measurements is naturally incorporated into the numeric computations via recreations of the probability distribution functions matched to experimental measurements of strain energy.

I also introduced a method for introducing crushed pebble fragments into an ensemble after pebble damage is predicted via the above criteria. The method was necessary to enforce conservation of mass between pebble beds before and after the crushing event which is necessary for also balancing the energy deposition into the bed from volumetric heating before and after the crushing event. We then showed that fragments increase the computational time as $(1/r_1^*)^{1/3}$ while the necessary minimum volume for inserting the particles follows roughly as $(r_1^*)^{1/3}$. The size of fragments may still influence the overall transport of energy in the system but in terms of localizing heat deposition due to settling fragments in interstitial regions, I also showed that the local packing fraction was changed very little over the range of radius ratios tested. Thus from the point of view of capturing proper thermophysics of the system, there does not seem to be a strict sensitivity to choice of radius ratio of fragmentations. Choice of fragmentation size will be driven by consideration of other physical features, in this study we will continue to treat it as a free parameter during investigations of fragmentation impact.

\section{Summary of DEM Modeling Development}

In the preceding sections I introduced all of the theory and numerical algorithms to be used in this dissertation in consideration of pebble-scale interactions. 

Among the contributions to the field of DE modeling for ceramic breeders, a modified Young's modulus (fit to a probabilistic distribution) is shown to be necessary to capture the observed scatter of elasticity of ceramic pebbles. The modified Young's Modulus is realized in DEM simulations with a numeric random generator satisfying a Fisher-Snedecor distribution fit to the experimental data of the pebble batch. A crush prediction algorithm was developed and implemented into DEM with a numeric random generator satisfying a Weibull distribution which assigns a critical bed-force value to each pebble. The value is constantly compared to all the contact forces acting upon a pebble in the ensemble to check for crush events. In the case of a crushed pebble, a volume-conserving pebble fragmentation script is used to simulate a broken pebble.

The power of applying the discrete element method to pebble beds - and especially pebble beds with a concern for pebble damage - is showcased in \Cref{sec:dem-studies}. Before that point, the DEM model will be augmented in two different means in order to incorporate the helium purge gas and its influences on thermal transport. The modeling development of these two methods will be introduced in the next series of sections.

% DEM, alone, neglects the thermal transport between pebbles and interstitial gas. Theoretically- and experimentally-based  correlations have been proposed to include stagnant gas heat transfer in DEM framework. We must address the helium influence on heat transfer within the pebble bed Ð two schemes are developed here
