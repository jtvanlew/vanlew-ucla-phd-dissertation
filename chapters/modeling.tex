This chapter presents the motivations and background of this study. First, it discusses energy usage in our society and the inevitable production of waste mechanical and thermal energies and their ubiquitous nature. This is followed by a brief discussion of common methods of converting ambient mechanical energy and waste heat into useful electrical energy. This chapter concludes with the objectives of this study and the scope of the document.

\section{Dynamic Coupling of Fluid-particle, Volume-averaged Modeling} \label{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
[talk about how lacking the DEM result is without the inclusion of helium in analysis. There are some Fusion papers on conductivity in vacuum and with helium]

We now consider the influence of helium on thermal transport of deposited nuclear energy as it is carried away by the cooled structural walls. We begin by considering the fluid in a continuum sense and the pebbles in a discrete one. The interactions of the fluid and solid are characterized by effective relationships in each discretized cell of fluid. We then consider an mesoscopic approach to the fluid-solid interaction with the Lattice-Boltzmann method. 

The chapter begins with introduction of the coupled fluid dynamics - discrete element method (CFD-DEM) approasec: governing equations, discretization techniques, and algorithms.

We then do LBM. And stuff.

\section{Static Coupling of Fluid-particle, Complete Modeling}\label{sec:modeling-lbm}
The volume-averaged approach of the CFD-DEM coupling is an effective and efficient method for solving transiently coupled helium flow and pebble interaction. However, there are cases when a complete knowledge of the tortuous flow of the interstitial helium is desired. But because the CFD-DEM solver does not resolve the pathways on the particle scale, knowledge of precise helium flow is not possible with that technique. Therefore we have also investigated a combination of DEM and with lattice-Boltzmann solvers. 

The lattice-Boltzmann approach to fluid simulations is a growing field of numerical modeling with a rich historical development. As the LBM approach is relatively unfamiliar, we will go through some of the notable evolutions of the modeling history and the background physics leading to the governing equations to be implemented numerically. Certainly this short study cannot do justice to a proper explanation of the underlying physics. References~\cite{Chen1998a,Viggen2009,Sukop2007,Chopard2002,succi2001lattice} should be read by those curious for excellent and thorough descriptions of the physics, modeling approaches, and applications of LBM theory to fluid dynamics problems.

In the rest of this chapter we introduce the core concepts behind the lattice-Boltzmann method, their application into numerical code, and finally a discussion of the solver used in this research.
