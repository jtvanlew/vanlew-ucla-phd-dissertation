\chapter{DEM Study on the Evolution of Effective Thermal Conductivity of a Pebble Bed Experiencing Pebble Crushing}\label{sec:dem-studies}
The discrete element method (DEM) is used by many ceramic breeder researchers to model the interaction of individual pebbles in an ensemble in an effort to obtain a more detailed understanding of pebble beds than is possible with experimental measurements of effective properties. For example see Refs.~\cite{An20071393, Lu2000, Zhao2010, Gan2010a, Annabattula2012a, VanLew2014}.
