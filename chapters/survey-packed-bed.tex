\chapter{Momentum and Energy Transfer in Packed Beds}\label{sec:survey-packed-beds}
We review the momentum and exchange between a fluid moving through a porous medium and the drag force correlations that are used in engineering practice. Then we walk through the many modes of energy exchange between contacting particles and particles with an interstitial gas.
