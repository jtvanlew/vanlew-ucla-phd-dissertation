\section{DEM Study on the Evolution of Effective Thermal Conductivity of a Pebble Bed Experiencing Pebble Crushing}\label{sec:dem-studies}
The discrete element method (DEM) is used by many ceramic breeder researchers to model the interaction of individual pebbles in an ensemble in an effort to obtain a more detailed understanding of pebble beds than is possible with experimental measurements of effective properties. For example see Refs.~\cite{An20071393, Lu2000, Zhao2010, Gan:2010uq, Annabattula2012a, VanLew2014}.

\section{Coupled CFD-DEM Models Revealing the Influence of Helium Purge Gas on Effective Thermal Conductivity of a Pebble Bed Experiencing Pebble Crushing}\label{sec:cfd-dem-studies}
The numerical implementation of fluid-solid interaction was outlined in \cref{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}. Although we are most interested in the thermal response of the packed beds to the interstitial gas, we will begin by comparing the results of momentum interaction.

\subsection{Modeling Setup and Procedure}
The pebble bed has dimensions in the x-y directions of 20d×15d, respectively. There are structural walls, providing cooling, at the x-limits and periodic walls in the y-limits. 10 000 pebbles were loaded into the system which went to a height of approximately 24d after the bed was vibration packed. The pebble bed had a roof loaded at the upper limit of the z-direction that was lowered by force-control up to 6 MPa. This bed is referred to as the ‘well-packed’ bed. This was meant to simulate a fresh, densely-packed bed that is under compressive load during fusion operation. As such, this would be when pebbles would be likely to crack during operation. Therefore, based on the well-packed bed, a second bed was generated by simulating crushed pebbles; crudely the extensive crushing is simulated by simply removing 10\% of the pebbles at random from the ensemble and then allowing the bed to resettle, from the now-imbalanced gravity and inter-particle forces, to a new stable packing structure. This bed is then referred to as the ‘resettled’ bed for the rest of the analysis. The intent is to deduce changes in thermo-mechanical properties from an ideally packed bed to one where significant cracking has altered the ideal morphology of the bed.

\section{Applications to Real Solid Breeder Blanket Designs}\label{sec:applied-studies}

In this study we apply coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method (CFD-DEM) modeling tools to study the combined effects of pebble crushing, packing restructuring due to both gravity and the unbalanced force network in the pebble bed, and convection from helium purge gas on subsequent temperature profiles in solid breeders for different breeding configurations. In typical solid breeder modules, coolant fluid runs through the containing structure surrounding the pebble bed. Heat is removed from the pebble bed predominately through inter-particle conduction and contact conductance of many pebbles pressed against the containing surface. As such, heat transfer out of the pebble bed relies on maintaining good pebble-pebble and pebble-wall contact. However, physical contact is interrupted to different degrees when a pebble bed responds to various amounts of individual crushed pebbles. Furthermore, the restructuring of the pebble bed after a pebble crushing event is, in part, dependent on gravity forces acting upon each pebble in the ensemble. We investigate two representative pebble bed configurations where heat is removed from the bed via inter-particle conduction, convection of purge gas, and contact between the pebble bed and its container. In the first, the coolant containing structural walls (heat transfer walls) are oriented parallel to the gravity force. In the second configuration, the heat transfer walls are perpendicular to the direction of gravity. To simulate a crushed pebble, we replace the pebble with many smaller, non-cohesive elements while maintaining mass-conservation between the original solid pebble and crushed fragments. The fragments are then free to resettle into interstitial gaps and the rest of the bed resettles as determined by forces from gravity, contact of neighboring particles, and even the small influence of the moving purge gas. The thermofluid interaction with the helium purge gas will be included with volume-averaged Navier-Stokes and energy equations. The representative solid breeder volumes will be compared with respect to their temperature peaks and profiles and how those temperatures vary as a function of the percentage of crushed pebbles in the ensemble. The results can be used to optimize solid breeder pebble bed designs through the choice of breeding zone orientation relative to the gravity vector.
