The numerical tools introduced in \cref{ch:modeling-development} are put to work for use on ceramic pebble beds in fusion reactors. In almost all cases, we have a representative volume of pebbles that is approximately $10000$ pebbles in size, confined in one direction by two primitive, rigid walls that act as heat sinks. Another direction employs periodic boundary conditions to represent an infinite length. The third direction is often in the gravity direction so we have an adiabatic, primitve, rigid roof/ceiling.

The first study considers the heat transfer in a pebble bed without the influence of helium purge gas. In this pebble bed, we use only the DEM tools to apply a nuclear heating source and allow the bed to reach a thermal steady-state with the cooling walls. In such a way we can determine an effective thermal conductivity of the bed. We then induce a fictitious damage to the bed and check the changes to effective thermal conductivity. The DEM tools allow interrogation of many micromechanical interactions in the pebble bed which we use to deduce the source of changes to the effective thermal conductivity.

In the second study, the same pebble bed is analyzed but this time the helium purge gas is included -- via the coupled CFD-DEM tools. We again induce some fictitious damage to the pebble bed and monitor changes to the thermophysical properties and their relationship to the similar cases when the helium purge gas was not included.

In the third study, we take snapshots of two beds (a standard bed and a damaged one) and load them into LBM models. This time we more closely analyze the tortuous path of helium moving through the pebble bed and discover interesting features of the purge gas thermal interaction that was masked in the volume-average approach of CFD-DEM.

\section{DEM Study on $\keff$ of Pebble Peds with Pebble Damage}\label{sec:dem-studies-effective-conductivity}
% The discrete element method (DEM) is used by many ceramic breeder researchers to model the interaction of individual pebbles in an ensemble in an effort to obtain a more detailed understanding of pebble beds than is possible with experimental measurements of effective properties. For example see Refs.~\cite{An20071393, Lu2000, Zhao2010, Gan:2010uq, Annabattula2012a, VanLew2014}.

% The discrete element method has been used for studies in a variety of fields for studying inter-particle forces and the homogeneously distributed force networks that arise in packed beds.\cite{Makse2000} 

The discrete element method has been used by researchers in the fusion community to attempt to model crushing initiation and propagation\cite{Annabattula2012a, Zhao2012, Zhao2013}. They observed that a relatively few number of high-force networks, distributed throughout the bed supported the external mechanical loads. The even distribution of the force networks was used to defend the development of a probability-based predictor for crushing by Zhao\etal.\cite{Zhao2013} The basic premise is that probability distributions of strength curves for pebble crushing have been observed (see, for example crush loads of Ref.~\cite{Tsuchiya1998}). Then in DEM models, a probability distribution of inter-particle forces are also observed. Overlaying the two probabilities resulted in seemingly random locations of pebbles satisfying the damage criteria -- not strictly along the high-force chains running through packed beds.

We apply the theory of Zhao\etal~to create fictitiously damaged beds without consideration of the initiation of the damage. If pebbles are crushed in random locations, we may de-couple the task of predicting pebble damage (\textit{i.e.} finding the mechanical or thermal load that causes a pebble to fail) from the task of modeling the ramifications of pebble crushing. As far as modeling the fragmentation, we begin with an extreme assumption of pulverization of the particle. Experiments on crushing single, brittle pebbles reveal that there are a number of failure modes\cite{Wu2004}. At one end, the pebble may simply crack and continue to hold a load for some time. At the other extreme, a pebble may crush practically into a dust. We concern ourselves with the latter for this study. When a pebble in our simulation has been flagged for damage, we remove the pebble completely from the ensemble and then allow the remaining pebbles to rearrange to compensate for the lack of equilibrium on their contact forces. Noting the limitations of this pulverizing damage model, in \cref{sec:failure-study} we outlined a fragmentation approach that will be applied to later models.

\subsection{Conclusions}
\label{sec:dem-conclusions}
This first study of this dissertation established the groundwork of the DEM modeling to be carried out in the other studies. We simulated a pebble bed with a specified fraction of the pebbles crushing during operation; then determining the repercussions of the missing pebbles as they affect the macroscopic property of effective thermal conductivity. We used the assumption of homogeneous, random locations of pebble failure to induce a failure routine without requiring external loads on the bed to actually induce the pebble crushing. After heating to a steady-state, an effective thermal conductivity was calculated for the pebble bed. The results show that large amounts of pebble failure correspond to large decreases in the conductive transport of energy through the pebble bed. The increase was due primarily to a drop in the inter-particle forces which lead to a large increase in temperature differences between neighboring pebbles.

As the first step in the modeling effort, there were many simplifications that had to be made in this study. We must note here the shortcomings of the assumptions and simplifications of this study before drawing any major conclusions from the results.

First, the `container walls' surrounding the pebble bed in this model are completely rigid and do not react as the swelling pebble bed presses into them while heating. The confined thermal expansion leads to very high contact forces in the pebble bed that may not be realistic. The abnormally high contact forces are most likely to be the source of the abnormally high baseline effective thermal conductivity, $k_0 = 1.03$~W/m-K. In experiments on the effective thermal conductivity of lithium ceramics in vacuum, the beds are often allowed to expand freely while heating (in at least one direction) and in vacuum were measured to be closer to $k_0 = 0.2$ W/m-K.\cite{Abou-Sena2005} Furthermore, as pointed out in the results, the initial contact force is strongly dependent on the \textit{initial packing state}. A different packing scheme was employed that resulted in the same initial packing fraction but with greatly reduced initial contact forces. 

Second, we saw from Fig.\ref{fig:temp-scatters} that the majority of the pebbles in the ensemble have their temperatures close fitting to an average curve but a number of the pebbles had less thermal contact with neighboring particles and consequently had much larger temperatures. This was true even in the baseline case of a tightly packed ($\phi = 64\%$) pebble bed. This phenomena is only possible because the contribution to heat transfer of the interstitial gas was not considered in this model. The flowing helium gas is expected to prevent any runaway temperatures of individual pebbles as it provides another route of energy transfer in the bed. This will be addressed in \cref{sec:cfd-dem-studies}.

Lastly, the pebble crushing did not conserve mass between pebble fragments and initial pebble. This is an issue we address in \cref{sec:fragmentation}, nor was there a predictive tool used to determine when pebbles would crush based on their inter-particle contact forces. We simply allowed an arbitrary number of pebbles to remove from the system. A predictive tool may not have expected even 2\% of the pebbles to be damaged, much less the 15\% we pushed the pebble bed to. The predictive tool is discussed in \cref{sec:failure-study} and will be applied to later models.

With the limitations mentioned, it is still worth discussing the results of this study in detail. The results shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:contact-forces-scatter} and~\ref{fig:coord-scatter} demonstrate that the heat transfer through a pebble bed is simultaneously a function of both the coordination number and inter-particle contact forces. The average values of both of these parameters reduced as pebbles in the bed were crushed. But by far the most important factor appears to be the inter-particle contact force. Between the baseline case and the bed with 15\% damage, the average inter-particle forces drop by an entire order of magnitude. The $\keff$ follow suit with a decrease to 10\% of the original value. Interestingly, when a pebble bed has lower overall inter-particle contact forces such as what we see when pebbles are crushed, we would predict fewer pebbles are likely to break. This result implies that pebble breakage is self-dampening; as pebbles begin to break the ensemble quickly relaxes and avoids future pebble failure. So while in this study we induced failure up to $\eta = 15\%$ without a concern for predicting if such a large amount would break, such large values may not occur in real beds during operation of a fusion reactor.

\section{Dynamically coupled CFD-DEM Study on $\keff$ of Pebble Peds with Pebble Damage}\label{sec:cfd-dem-studies}

We have established throughout this dissertation that the contribution of helium to the overall thermal transport of the ceramic pebble bed is important. Furthermore, in the DEM study on effective thermal conductivity, we discovered the appearance of many hot rattlers in the pebble bed -- even well-packed pebble beds. These pebbles heat from the volumetric source but have no outlet for the energy as their few contacts with neighbors are very light (see the scattered data of Fig.~\ref{fig:temp-scatters-zoomed}). The interstitial helium will provide another avenue for energy transport for these rattlers, potentially removing them as hot spots from the system completely. 

Therefore, in this section we work to introduce one method of coupling the discrete element method to a thermo-fluid model of helium. This first approach is to consider the helium as a continuum with volume-averaged contributions of the pebbles in each computational cell. The numerical implementation of fluid-solid interaction was outlined in \cref{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}.

\subsection{Conclusions}
The CFD-DEM formulation maintains calculations of pebble-pebble interactions while dynamically coupling to the helium flow. The model demonstrates the ability of helium gas to smooth out any hot spots predicted by pure-conduction DEM formulations. Further, the lattice-Boltzmann simulation, while not fully coupled to DEM, revealed important features of helium flow in volumetrically heated pebble beds – mainly the smearing of temperature profiles along the paths of cooling.
