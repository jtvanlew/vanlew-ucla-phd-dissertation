This chapter presents the motivations and background of this study. First, it discusses energy usage in our society and the inevitable production of waste mechanical and thermal energies and their ubiquitous nature. This is followed by a brief discussion of common methods of converting ambient mechanical energy and waste heat into useful electrical energy. This chapter concludes with the objectives of this study and the scope of the document.
