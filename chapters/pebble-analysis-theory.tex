\chapter{Pebble Interaction Analysis: Theory} \label{sec:analysis-theory}


This chapter will walk through the analysis first performed by Heinrich Hertz in 1880 of idealized interacting spherical objects to represent our ceramic pebbles. We will begin with mechanical interactions of purely elastic spheres and then use the results to develop a theory for conductive heat transfer between the pebbles. Finally, Hertz's theory will also be used to analyze pebble interaction with flat plattens in our test stand used to measure crush force. A relationship is developed allowing us to translate from experimental results to pebble bed ensembles.
