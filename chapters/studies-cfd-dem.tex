\chapter{Coupled CFD-DEM Models Revealing the Influence of Helium Purge Gas on Effective Thermal Conductivity of a Pebble Bed Experiencing Pebble Crushing}\label{sec:cfd-dem-studies}
The numerical implementation of fluid-solid interaction was outline in \cref{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}. Although we are most interested in the thermal response of the packed beds to the interestitial gas, we will begin by comparing the results of momentum interaction.
\subsection{Modeling Setup and Procedure}
The pebble bed has dimensions in the x-y directions of 20d×15d, respectively. There are structural walls, providing cooling, at the x-limits and periodic walls in the y-limits. 10 000 pebbles were loaded into the system which went to a height of approximately 24d after the bed was vibration packed. The pebble bed had a roof loaded at the upper limit of the z-direction that was lowered by force-control up to 6 MPa. This bed is referred to as the ‘well-packed’ bed. This was meant to simulate a fresh, densely-packed bed that is under compressive load during fusion operation. As such, this would be when pebbles would be likely to crack during operation. Therefore, based on the well-packed bed, a second bed was generated by simulating crushed pebbles; crudely the extensive crushing is simulated by simply removing 10\% of the pebbles at random from the ensemble and then allowing the bed to resettle, from the now-imbalanced gravity and inter-particle forces, to a new stable packing structure. This bed is then referred to as the ‘resettled’ bed for the rest of the analysis. The intent is to deduce changes in thermo-mechanical properties from an ideally packed bed to one where significant cracking has altered the ideal morphology of the bed.
