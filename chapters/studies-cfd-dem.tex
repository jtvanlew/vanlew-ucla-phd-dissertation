\chapter{CFD-DEM studies}\label{sec:cfd-dem-studies}
The numerical implementation of fluid-solid interaction was outline in \cref{sec:modeling-cfd-dem}. Although we are most interested in the thermal response of the packed beds to the interestitial gas, we will begin by comparing the results of momentum interaction.
