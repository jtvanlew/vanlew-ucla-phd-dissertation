\chapter{Pebble Interaction Analysis: Experimental Relationships} \label{sec:analysis-experiment}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Many experiments were carried out on individual ceramic pebbles. While there are some measures from experiments that are immediately useful for qualitative comparisons, such as the crush strength between different batches of ceramics, most values are not obviously connected to analysis of the pebbles nor the pebble bed assemblies they make up. In this section we will show had careful examination of single pebble experiments can lead to predictions of not only strength in ensembles but also modifications of the fundamental properties of the ceramic pebbles.

In section \cref{sec:exp-reduction-factor}, we use single pebble experiments to validate the use of Hertz theory for contacting ceramic pebbles, but also determine the proper Young's modulus to use for the ceramics. In section \cref{sec:exp-strain-energy} we use the theory we developed in section \cref{sec:theory-strain-energy} along with experimental data to begin to make predictions for survivability of pebbles in ensembles.
